To do so,\\nwe generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the\\nsegmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes\\nusing the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in\\nFaster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the\\nregion proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed\\ninto Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the\\nnatural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long\\nShort- Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and\\ntext features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the\\nhighest score is retrieved as the output of our system.

We demonstrate its high prediction\\naccuracy and sensitivity through the task of predictive feature selection on a\\nsimulated dataset and the application of predicting open chromatin sites in the\\nhuman genome. On the simulated data, our method achieved high fidelity recovery\\nof feature contributions under random noise levels up to 200%. On the open\\nchromatin dataset, the application of our method not only outperformed the\\nstate of the art method in terms of accuracy, but also unveiled two previously\\nunfound open chromatin related histone marks. Our method can fill the blank of\\naccurate and interpretable nonlinear modeling in scientific data mining tasks.\\n', '  Many people are suffering from voice disorders, which can adversely affect\\nthe quality of their lives. In response, some researchers have proposed\\nalgorithms for automatic assessment of these disorders, based on voice signals.\\nHowever, these signals can be sensitive to the recording devices. Indeed, the\\nchannel effect is a pervasive problem in machine learning for healthcare. In\\nthis study, we propose a detection system for pathological voice, which is\\nrobust against the channel effect. This system is based on a bidirectional LSTM\\nnetwork. To increase the performance robustness against channel mismatch, we\\nintegrate domain adversarial training (DAT) to eliminate the differences\\nbetween the devices. When we train on data recorded on a high-quality\\nmicrophone and evaluate on smartphone data without labels, our robust detection\\nsystem increases the PR-AUC from 0.8448 to 0.9455 (and 0.9522 with target\\nsample labels). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying\\nunsupervised domain adaptation to pathological voice detection. Notably, our\\nsystem does not need target device sample labels, which allows for\\ngeneralization to many new devices.\\n', '  End-to-end approaches have drawn much attention recently for significantly\\nsimplifying the construction of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.\\nRNN transducer (RNN-T) is one of the popular end-to-end methods.

In this paper, we explore RNN-T\\nfor a Chinese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task and\\naim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance. First, a\\nnew strategy of learning rate decay is proposed to accelerate the model\\nconvergence. Second, we find that adding convolutional layers at the beginning\\nof the network and using ordered data can discard the pre-training process of\\nthe encoder without loss of performance. Besides, we design experiments to find\\na balance among the usage of GPU memory, training circle and model performance.\\nFinally, we achieve 16.9% character error rate (CER) on our test set which is\\n2% absolute improvement from a strong BLSTM CE system with language model\\ntrained on the same text corpus.\\n', \"  Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar\\ncomputations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods\\nfor neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'\\nand 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among\\nmany neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design\\nneeds to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable\\nrecordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one\\ncan sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show\\nthat a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to\\nneural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a\\nproblem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN\\narchitecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and\\nfeature (what) dimensions.

In this paper, we study a method to learn\\nthe model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach\\nis expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an\\narchitectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to\\na larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new\\nsearch space (the \"NASNet search space\") which enables transferability. In our\\nexperiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or \"cell\") on the\\nCIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking\\ntogether more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a\\nconvolutional architecture, named \"NASNet architecture\". We also introduce a\\nnew regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly\\nimproves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet\\nachieves 2.4% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet\\nachieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1\\nand 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than\\nthe best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a\\nreduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art\\nmodel. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of\\nNASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For\\ninstance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74% top-1 accuracy, which is\\n3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile\\nplatforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN\\nframework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0% achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO\\ndataset.\\n', \"  Large-scale datasets have played a significant role in progress of neural\\nnetwork and deep learning areas.

By combining bibliometric data from Web of Science and Twitter\\nusers identified by Altmetric.com we have obtained the largest set of\\nindividual scholars matched with Twitter users made so far. Our methodology\\nconsists of a combination of matching algorithms, considering different\\nlinguistic elements of both author names and Twitter names; followed by a\\nrule-based scoring system that weights the common occurrence of several\\nelements related with the names, individual elements and activities of both\\nTwitter users and scholars matched. Our results indicate that about 2% of the\\noverall population of scholars in the Web of Science is active on Twitter. By\\ndomain we find a strong presence of researchers from the Social Sciences and\\nthe Humanities. Natural Sciences is the domain with the lowest level of\\nscholars on Twitter. Researchers on Twitter also tend to be younger than those\\nthat are not on Twitter. As this is a bibliometric-based approach, it is\\nimportant to highlight the reliance of the method on the number of publications\\nproduced and tweeted by the scholars, thus the share of scholars on Twitter\\nranges between 1% and 5% depending on their level of productivity. Further\\nresearch is suggested in order to improve and expand the methodology.\\n', '  In processing human produced text using natural language processing (NLP)\\ntechniques, two fundamental subtasks that arise are (i) segmentation of the\\nplain text into meaningful subunits (e.g., entities), and (ii) dependency\\nparsing, to establish relations between subunits. In this paper, we develop a\\nrelatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both\\nsegmentation and dependency parsing together, instead of one after the other as\\nin most state-of-the-art works. We will focus in particular on the real estate\\nad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name\\nproperty tree, comprising the tasks of (1) identifying important entities of a\\nproperty (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree\\nformat. In this work, we propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the\\ntwo tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the\\nerror propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a\\npipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks.\\nFor this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline\\nmethods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over\\nthree percentage points in the overall edge F1 score of the property tree.\\nAlso, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient\\ntokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally\\ndemonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed\\njoint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge\\nF1 score for our application.\\n', '  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great\\nsuccess in many visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep neural network\\nmodels are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their\\ndeployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict\\nlatency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model\\ncompression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing\\nthe model performance. During the past few years, tremendous progress has been\\nmade in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent advanced techniques for\\ncompacting and accelerating CNNs model developed. These techniques are roughly\\ncategorized into four schemes: parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank\\nfactorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge\\ndistillation. Methods of parameter pruning and sharing will be described at the\\nbeginning, after that the other techniques will be introduced. For each scheme,\\nwe provide insightful analysis regarding the performance, related applications,\\nadvantages, and drawbacks etc. Then we will go through a few very recent\\nadditional successful methods, for example, dynamic capacity networks and\\nstochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrix, the\\nmain datasets used for evaluating the model performance and recent benchmarking\\nefforts. Finally, we conclude this paper, discuss remaining challenges and\\npossible directions on this topic.\\n', '  This paper proposes a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion (VC) method\\nusing a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an\\nauxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE). The proposed method has three key features.\\nFirst, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and\\ndecoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture\\ntime dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target\\nspeech. Second, it uses an information-theoretic regularization for the model\\ntraining to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not\\nbe lost in the conversion process. With regular CVAEs, the encoder and decoder\\nare free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic\\nsince in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on\\ncontrolling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such\\nsituations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training\\nthe encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs\\nare correctly predicted by the classifier. Third, it avoids producing\\nbuzzy-sounding speech at test time by simply transplanting the spectral details\\nof the input speech into its converted version. Subjective evaluation\\nexperiments revealed that this simple method worked reasonably well in a\\nnon-parallel many-to-many speaker identity conversion task.\\n', '  One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect\\nof physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal\\naction selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are\\napproximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific\\nstate representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data,\\nespecially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we\\nhave seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical\\ninteractions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how\\nfar these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we\\ninvestigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning\\napproaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and\\nshow how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of\\nboth worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which\\nthere exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We\\npropose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or\\norganized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model\\nand compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and\\nprediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large\\nreal-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture.\\nCompared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required\\ntraining data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.\\n', \"  Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents,\\nknowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others and recognize that these mental states\\nmay differ from one's own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective\\ncommunication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To\\neffectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our\\nlives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together\\nin a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI\\nmore accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human\\nintentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI\\nmore human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we\\nargue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a\\ntheory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,\\nand quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question\\nAnswering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples (50), lay people can be\\ntrained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA\\nmodel. We further evaluate the role existing explanation (or interpretability)\\nmodalities play in helping humans build ToAIM. Explainable AI has received\\nconsiderable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we\\nfind that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its\\ntop-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions\\nin the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening\\nto) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better\\npredict its behavior.\\n\", '  We present a clustering-based language model using word embeddings for text\\nreadability prediction. Presumably, an Euclidean semantic space hypothesis\\nholds true for word embeddings whose training is done by observing word\\nco-occurrences. We argue that clustering with word embeddings in the metric\\nspace should yield feature representations in a higher semantic space\\nappropriate for text regression. Also, by representing features in terms of\\nhistograms, our approach can naturally address documents of varying lengths. An\\nempirical evaluation using the Common Core Standards corpus reveals that the\\nfeatures formed on our clustering-based language model significantly improve\\nthe previously known results for the same corpus in readability prediction. We\\nalso evaluate the task of sentence matching based on semantic relatedness using\\nthe Wiki-SimpleWiki corpus and find that our features lead to superior matching\\nperformance.\\n', '  In automatic speech processing systems, speaker diarization is a crucial\\nfront-end component to separate segments from different speakers. Inspired by\\nthe recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in semantic inferencing,\\ntriplet loss-based architectures have been successfully used for this problem.\\nHowever, existing work utilizes conventional i-vectors as the input\\nrepresentation and builds simple fully connected networks for metric learning,\\nthus not fully leveraging the modeling power of DNN architectures. This paper\\ninvestigates the importance of learning effective representations from the\\nsequences directly in metric learning pipelines for speaker diarization. More\\nspecifically, we propose to employ attention models to learn embeddings and the\\nmetric jointly in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments are conducted on the\\nCALLHOME conversational speech corpus. The diarization results demonstrate\\nthat, besides providing a unified model, the proposed approach achieves\\nimproved performance when compared against existing approaches.\\n', '  The best summary of a long video differs among different people due to its\\nhighly subjective nature. Even for the same person, the best summary may change\\nwith time or mood. In this paper, we introduce the task of generating\\ncustomized video summaries through simple text. First, we train a deep\\narchitecture to effectively learn semantic embeddings of video frames by\\nleveraging the abundance of image-caption data via a progressive and residual\\nmanner. Given a user-specific text description, our algorithm is able to select\\nsemantically relevant video segments and produce a temporally aligned video\\nsummary. In order to evaluate our textually customized video summaries, we\\nconduct experimental comparison with baseline methods that utilize ground-truth\\ninformation. Despite the challenging baselines, our method still manages to\\nshow comparable or even exceeding performance. We also show that our method is\\nable to generate semantically diverse video summaries by only utilizing the\\nlearned visual embeddings.\\n', \"  In recent years, research has been done on applying Recurrent Neural Networks\\n(RNNs) as recommender systems. Results have been promising, especially in the\\nsession-based setting where RNNs have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art\\nmodels. In many of these experiments, the RNN could potentially improve the\\nrecommendations by utilizing information about the user's past sessions, in\\naddition to its own interactions in the current session. A problem for\\nsession-based recommendation, is how to produce accurate recommendations at the\\nstart of a session, before the system has learned much about the user's current\\ninterests. We propose a novel approach that extends a RNN recommender to be\\nable to process the user's recent sessions, in order to improve\\nrecommendations. This is done by using a second RNN to learn from recent\\nsessions, and predict the user's interest in the current session. By feeding\\nthis information to the original RNN, it is able to improve its\\nrecommendations. Our experiments on two different datasets show that the\\nproposed approach can significantly improve recommendations throughout the\\nsessions, compared to a single RNN working only on the current session. The\\nproposed model especially improves recommendations at the start of sessions,\\nand is therefore able to deal with the cold start problem within sessions.\\n\", '  A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes\\nrepresent the units of the network and edges represent connections between\\nthose units. For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons\\nbetween neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a\\ndisproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges\\nbetween each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different\\nnetworks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network\\nintegration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity\\nstructure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a\\nmyriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse\\nclub--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network.\\nThe diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties\\nconsistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly\\ninterconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global\\nintegration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that\\nproduces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating\\nthat these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.\\nGiven the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the\\nmacaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air\\ntraffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These\\nresults warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in\\nall complex systems.\\n', '  Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for image\\nclassification and object detection. However, the impact of deep learning on\\nvideo analysis (e.g. action detection and recognition) has been limited due to\\ncomplexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural\\nnetworks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two\\nmajor steps: frame-level action proposal detection and association of proposals\\nacross frames. Also, these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle\\nspatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper, we propose an\\nend-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for\\naction detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified network that\\nis able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A\\nvideo is first divided into equal length clips and for each clip a set of tube\\nproposals are generated next based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet)\\nfeatures. Finally, the tube proposals of different clips are linked together\\nemploying network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using\\nthese linked video proposals. Extensive experiments on several video datasets\\ndemonstrate the superior performance of T-CNN for classifying and localizing\\nactions in both trimmed and untrimmed videos compared to state-of-the-arts.\\n', '  Very often features come with their own vectorial descriptions which provide\\ndetailed information about their properties.

In the standard learning scenario,\\ninput is represented as a vector of features and the feature side-information\\nis most often ignored or used only for feature selection prior to model\\nfitting. We believe that feature side-information which carries information\\nabout features intrinsic property will help improve model prediction if used in\\na proper way during learning process. In this paper, we propose a framework\\nthat allows for the incorporation of the feature side-information during the\\nlearning of very general model families to improve the prediction performance.\\nWe control the structures of the learned models so that they reflect features\\nsimilarities as these are defined on the basis of the side-information. We\\nperform experiments on a number of benchmark datasets which show significant\\npredictive performance gains, over a number of baselines, as a result of the\\nexploitation of the side-information.\\n', '  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise\\nobjects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes.

We show that\\nImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather\\nthan shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and\\nreveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate\\nthat the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based\\nrepresentation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation\\ninstead when trained on \"Stylized-ImageNet\", a stylized version of ImageNet.\\nThis provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our\\nwell-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560\\npsychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of\\nunexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and\\npreviously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,\\nhighlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.\\n', \"  An important, yet largely unstudied, problem in student data analysis is to\\ndetect misconceptions from students' responses to open-response questions.\\nMisconception detection enables instructors to deliver more targeted feedback\\non the misconceptions exhibited by many students in their class, thus improving\\nthe quality of instruction.

We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art\\nperformance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to\\nother 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver\\nlesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying\\nour 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we\\nreach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods. The\\nobtained results illustrate the strong potential and versatility of the\\npipeline by achieving highly accurate results on multi-modality images from\\ndifferent anatomical regions and organs.\\n', '  Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous potential for Automatic Text\\nScoring (ATS) tasks. In this paper, we describe a new neural architecture that\\nenhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence\\nfeatures. Our new method proposes a new \\\\textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism that models\\nrelationships between snapshots of the hidden representations of a long\\nshort-term memory (LSTM) network as it reads. Subsequently, the semantic\\nrelationships between multiple snapshots are used as auxiliary features for\\nprediction. This has two main benefits. Firstly, essays are typically long\\nsequences and therefore the memorization capability of the LSTM network may be\\ninsufficient. Implicit access to multiple snapshots can alleviate this problem\\nby acting as a protection against vanishing gradients. The parameters of the\\n\\\\textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism also acts as an auxiliary memory. Secondly,\\nmodeling relationships between multiple positions allows our model to learn\\nfeatures that represent and approximate textual coherence. In our model, we\\ncall this \\\\textit{neural coherence} features. Overall, we present a unified\\ndeep learning architecture that generates neural coherence features as it reads\\nin an end-to-end fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art\\nperformance on the benchmark ASAP dataset, outperforming not only feature\\nengineering baselines but also other deep learning models.\\n', '  Developers increasingly rely on text matching tools to analyze the relation\\nbetween natural language words and APIs. However, semantic gaps, namely textual\\nmismatches between words and APIs, negatively affect these tools. Previous\\nstudies have transformed words or APIs into low-dimensional vectors for\\nmatching; however, inaccurate results were obtained due to the failure of\\nmodeling words and APIs simultaneously. To resolve this problem, two main\\nchallenges are to be addressed: the acquisition of massive words and APIs for\\nmining and the alignment of words and APIs for modeling. Therefore, this study\\nproposes Word2API to effectively estimate relatedness of words and APIs.\\nWord2API collects millions of commonly used words and APIs from code\\nrepositories to address the acquisition challenge. Then, a shuffling strategy\\nis used to transform related words and APIs into tuples to address the\\nalignment challenge. Using these tuples, Word2API models words and APIs\\nsimultaneously. Word2API outperforms baselines by 10%-49.6% of relatedness\\nestimation in terms of precision and NDCG. Word2API is also effective on\\nsolving typical software tasks, e.g., query expansion and API documents\\nlinking. A simple system with Word2API-expanded queries recommends up to 21.4%\\nmore related APIs for developers. Meanwhile, Word2API improves comparison\\nalgorithms by 7.9%-17.4% in linking questions in Question&Answer communities to\\nAPI documents.\\n', '  Extensive efforts have been devoted to recognizing facial action units (AUs).\\nHowever, it is still challenging to recognize AUs from spontaneous facial\\ndisplays especially when they are accompanied with speech. Different from all\\nprior work that utilized visual observations for facial AU recognition, this\\npaper presents a novel approach that recognizes speech-related AUs exclusively\\nfrom audio signals based on the fact that facial activities are highly\\ncorrelated with voice during speech. Specifically, dynamic and physiological\\nrelationships between AUs and phonemes are modeled through a continuous time\\nBayesian network (CTBN); then AU recognition is performed by probabilistic\\ninference via the CTBN model.\\nA pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been constructed to evaluate the\\nproposed audio-based AU recognition framework. The database consists of a\\n\"clean\" subset with frontal and neutral faces and a challenging subset\\ncollected with large head movements and occlusions. Experimental results on\\nthis database show that the proposed CTBN model achieves promising recognition\\nperformance for 7 speech-related AUs and outperforms the state-of-the-art\\nvisual-based methods especially for those AUs that are activated at low\\nintensities or \"hardly visible\" in the visual channel. Furthermore, the CTBN\\nmodel yields more impressive recognition performance on the challenging subset,\\nwhere the visual-based approaches suffer significantly.\\n', '  We introduce a new paradigm that is important for community detection in the\\nrealm of network analysis. Networks contain a set of strong, dominant\\ncommunities, which interfere with the detection of weak, natural community\\nstructure. When most of the members of the weak communities also belong to\\nstronger communities, they are extremely hard to be uncovered. We call the weak\\ncommunities the hidden community structure.\\nWe present a novel approach called HICODE (HIdden COmmunity DEtection) that\\nidentifies the hidden community structure as well as the dominant community\\nstructure. By weakening the strength of the dominant structure, one can uncover\\nthe hidden structure beneath. Likewise, by reducing the strength of the hidden\\nstructure, one can more accurately identify the dominant structure. In this\\nway, HICODE tackles both tasks simultaneously.\\nExtensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that HICODE\\noutperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in uncovering\\nboth the dominant and the hidden structure. In the Facebook university social\\nnetworks, we find multiple non-redundant sets of communities that are strongly\\nassociated with residential hall, year of registration or career position of\\nthe faculties or students, while the state-of-the-art algorithms mainly locate\\nthe dominant ground truth category. In the Due to the difficulty of labeling\\nall ground truth communities in real-world datasets, HICODE provides a\\npromising approach to pinpoint the existing latent communities and uncover\\ncommunities for which there is no ground truth. Finding this unknown structure\\nis an extremely important community detection problem.\\n', '  Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of\\nmachine learning tasks, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, and\\nmachine translation.

In this work, we investigated multiple widely used\\nensemble methods, including unweighted averaging, majority voting, the Bayes\\nOptimal Classifier, and the (discrete) Super Learner, for image recognition\\ntasks, with deep neural networks as candidate algorithms. We designed several\\nexperiments, with the candidate algorithms being the same network structure\\nwith different model checkpoints within a single training process, networks\\nwith same structure but trained multiple times stochastically, and networks\\nwith different structure. In addition, we further studied the over-confidence\\nphenomenon of the neural networks, as well as its impact on the ensemble\\nmethods.

At each pyramid\\nlevel, our model takes coarse-resolution feature maps as input, predicts the\\nhigh-frequency residuals, and uses transposed convolutions for upsampling to\\nthe finer level. Our method does not require the bicubic interpolation as the\\npre-processing step and thus dramatically reduces the computational complexity.\\nWe train the proposed LapSRN with deep supervision using a robust Charbonnier\\nloss function and achieve high-quality reconstruction. Furthermore, our network\\ngenerates multi-scale predictions in one feed-forward pass through the\\nprogressive reconstruction, thereby facilitates resource-aware applications.\\nExtensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets show\\nthat the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art\\nmethods in terms of speed and accuracy.\\n', '  We explore different approaches to integrating a simple convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) with the Lucene search engine in a multi-stage ranking\\narchitecture. Our models are trained using the PyTorch deep learning toolkit,\\nwhich is implemented in C/C++ with a Python frontend. One obvious integration\\nstrategy is to expose the neural network directly as a service. For this, we\\nuse Apache Thrift, a software framework for building scalable cross-language\\nservices. In exploring alternative architectures, we observe that once trained,\\nthe feedforward evaluation of neural networks is quite straightforward.\\nTherefore, we can extract the parameters of a trained CNN from PyTorch and\\nimport the model into Java, taking advantage of the Java Deeplearning4J library\\nfor feedforward evaluation. This has the advantage that the entire end-to-end\\nsystem can be implemented in Java. As a third approach, we can extract the\\nneural network from PyTorch and \"compile\" it into a C++ program that exposes a\\nThrift service. We evaluate these alternatives in terms of performance (latency\\nand throughput) as well as ease of integration. Experiments show that\\nfeedforward evaluation of the convolutional neural network is significantly\\nslower in Java, while the performance of the compiled C++ network does not\\nconsistently beat the PyTorch implementation.\\n', '  Background: As most of the software development organizations are\\nmale-dominated, female developers encountering various negative workplace\\nexperiences reported feeling like they \"do not belong\". Exposures to\\ndiscriminatory expletives or negative critiques from their male colleagues may\\nfurther exacerbate those feelings. Aims: The primary goal of this study is to\\nidentify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female\\ndevelopers during various software engineering tasks. Method: On this goal, we\\nmined the code review repositories of six popular open source projects. We used\\na semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as multiple social\\nnetworks to identify the gender of a developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and\\nstate-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain,\\nwe classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also\\ncompute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by\\neach developer. Results: Our results suggest that the likelihood of using\\nsentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on\\nthe gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express\\nsentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their\\nmale colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the\\nsix projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also\\nwithholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Conclusion:\\nOur results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative\\nwork place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be\\ncontributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.\\n', '  Semantic segmentation and object detection research have recently achieved\\nrapid progress. However, the former task has no notion of different instances\\nof the same object, and the latter operates at a coarse, bounding-box level. We\\npropose an Instance Segmentation system that produces a segmentation map where\\neach pixel is assigned an object class and instance identity label. Most\\napproaches adapt object detectors to produce segments instead of boxes. In\\ncontrast, our method is based on an initial semantic segmentation module, which\\nfeeds into an instance subnetwork. This subnetwork uses the initial\\ncategory-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object\\ndetector, within an end-to-end CRF to predict instances. This part of our model\\nis dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per\\nimage. Our end-to-end approach requires no post-processing and considers the\\nimage holistically, instead of processing independent proposals. Therefore,\\nunlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to multiple instances.\\nFurthermore, far more precise segmentations are achieved, as shown by our\\nstate-of-the-art results (particularly at high IoU thresholds) on the Pascal\\nVOC and Cityscapes datasets.\\n', '  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose.\\nLinguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but\\nthis is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce\\nnon-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic\\ncorrection of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex\\nnetworks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short\\ntexts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were\\napplied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in\\ntranscripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the\\nperformance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic\\nfeatures for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and\\nArizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using\\nonly complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other\\nclassifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and\\nCinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably\\nowing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded\\nhigher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually\\nrevised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched\\nwith embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments\\n', '  Software developers frequently issue generic natural language queries for\\ncode search while using code search engines (e.g., GitHub native search,\\nKrugle). Such queries often do not lead to any relevant results due to\\nvocabulary mismatch problems. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that\\nautomatically identifies relevant and specific API classes from Stack Overflow\\nQ & A site for a programming task written as a natural language query, and then\\nreformulates the query for improved code search. We first collect candidate API\\nclasses from Stack Overflow using pseudo-relevance feedback and two term\\nweighting algorithms, and then rank the candidates using Borda count and\\nsemantic proximity between query keywords and the API classes. The semantic\\nproximity has been determined by an analysis of 1.3 million questions and\\nanswers of Stack Overflow. Experiments using 310 code search queries report\\nthat our technique suggests relevant API classes with 48% precision and 58%\\nrecall which are 32% and 48% higher respectively than those of the\\nstate-of-the-art. Comparisons with two state-of-the-art studies and three\\npopular search engines (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, and GitHub native search)\\nreport that our reformulated queries (1) outperform the queries of the\\nstate-of-the-art, and (2) significantly improve the code search results\\nprovided by these contemporary search engines.\\n', '  Most state-of-the-art information extraction approaches rely on token-level\\nlabels to find the areas of interest in text.

End-to-end (E2E) models,\\nwhich take raw text as input and produce the desired output directly, need not\\ndepend on token-level labels.

This forms a truly end-to-end, from\\nsoftware-to-hardware open source stack for deep learning systems.\\n\", '  Human action recognition in videos is one of the most challenging tasks in\\ncomputer vision. One important issue is how to design discriminative features\\nfor representing spatial context and temporal dynamics. Here, we introduce a\\npath signature feature to encode information from intra-frame and inter-frame\\ncontexts. A key step towards leveraging this feature is to construct the proper\\ntrajectories (paths) for the data steam. In each frame, the correlated\\nconstraints of human joints are treated as small paths, then the spatial path\\nsignature features are extracted from them. In video data, the evolution of\\nthese spatial features over time can also be regarded as paths from which the\\ntemporal path signature features are extracted. Eventually, all these features\\nare concatenated to constitute the input vector of a fully connected neural\\nnetwork for action classification. Experimental results on four standard\\nbenchmark action datasets, J-HMDB, SBU Dataset, Berkeley MHAD, and NTURGB+D\\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even\\nin comparison with recent deep learning based models.\\n', \"  Recent machine learning models have shown that including attention as a\\ncomponent results in improved model accuracy and interpretability, despite the\\nconcept of attention in these approaches only loosely approximating the brain's\\nattention mechanism.

In this work, we study\\nsockpuppetry across nine discussion communities, and show that sockpuppets\\ndiffer from ordinary users in terms of their posting behavior, linguistic\\ntraits, as well as social network structure. Sockpuppets tend to start fewer\\ndiscussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as \"I\", and\\nhave more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of sockpuppets controlled by\\nthe same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the\\nsame time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of\\ndeceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of sockpuppets can vary in\\ntheir deceptiveness, i.e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their\\nsupportiveness, i.e., if they support arguments of other sockpuppets controlled\\nby the same user. We apply these findings to a series of prediction tasks,\\nnotably, to identify whether a pair of accounts belongs to the same underlying\\nuser or not. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of deception in\\nonline discussion communities and paves the way towards the automatic detection\\nof sockpuppets.\\n', '  Recent progress in deep learning for audio synthesis opens the way to models\\nthat directly produce the waveform, shifting away from the traditional paradigm\\nof relying on vocoders or MIDI synthesizers for speech or music generation.\\nDespite their successes, current state-of-the-art neural audio synthesizers\\nsuch as WaveNet and SampleRNN suffer from prohibitive training and inference\\ntimes because they are based on autoregressive models that generate audio\\nsamples one at a time at a rate of 16kHz.

For data\\ngeneration, we employ the public databases: CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online\\nHMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate shape\\nvariations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs\\nto get more structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these\\nstrategies to maximize shape and structural variations. The generated online\\nHMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition.

The key challenge is to address the opaque\\nnature of the language interoperability interface: one language calling\\nprocedures in a second (which may call a third, or even back to the first),\\nresulting in a potentially tangled, inefficient and insecure codebase. An\\narchitecture is proposed for lightweight static analysis of large multilingual\\ncodebases: the MLSA architecture. Its modular and table-oriented structure\\naddresses the open-ended nature of multiple languages and language\\ninteroperability APIs.

Another is\\nthat standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes\\nhard to obtain, and it is desirable to learn to recognize objects from few\\nexamples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing\\nnovel, flexible, and interpretable models for few-shot learning.

By pooling the frame-level features,\\nutterance-level representations, called d-vectors, can be derived and used in\\nthe automatic speaker verification (ASV) task. This simple average pooling,\\nhowever, is inherently sensitive to the phonetic content of the utterance. An\\ninteresting idea borrowed from machine translation is the attention-based\\nmechanism, where the contribution of an input word to the translation at a\\nparticular time is weighted by an attention score. This score reflects the\\nrelevance of the input word and the present translation. We can use the same\\nidea to align utterances with different phonetic contents. This paper proposes\\na phonetic-attention scoring approach for d-vector systems. By this approach,\\nan attention score is computed for each frame pair. This score reflects the\\nsimilarity of the two frames in phonetic content, and is used to weigh the\\ncontribution of this frame pair in the utterance-based scoring.

Social Network Analysis cope with\\ndifferent problems namely network metrics, models, visualization and\\ninformation spreading, each one with several approaches, methods and\\nalgorithms. One of the critical areas of Social Network Analysis involves the\\ncalculation of different centrality measures (i.e.: the most important vertices\\nwithin a graph).

However, in biomedical imaging, it is very\\nchallenging to create such large annotated datasets, as annotating biomedical\\nimages is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding\\nof costly, specialty-oriented skills, which are not easily accessible. To\\ndramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method to\\nnaturally integrate active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a\\nsingle framework, called AFT*, which starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to\\nseek \"worthy\" samples for annotation and gradually enhance the (fine-tuned) CNN\\nvia continuous fine-tuning. We have evaluated our method in three distinct\\nbiomedical imaging applications, demonstrating that it can cut the annotation\\ncost by at least half, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method. This\\nperformance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced\\nactive, continuous learning capability of our method.

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no\\nstudy of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they\\nare likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning\\nmodels for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study\\nof adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models\\nexploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we\\ntackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus\\non the training phase of a machine learning model. We generate adversarial\\nperturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus,\\ntaking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that\\nthe perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data\\ncharacteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an\\nefficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our\\nexperimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly\\ndrops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are\\ntransferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node\\nclassification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful\\neven when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.\\n\", '  The understanding of variations in genome sequences assists us in identifying\\npeople who are predisposed to common diseases, solving rare diseases, and\\nfinding the corresponding population group of the individuals from a larger\\npopulation group. Although classical machine learning techniques allow\\nresearchers to identify groups (i.e. clusters) of related variables, the\\naccuracy, and effectiveness of these methods diminish for large and\\nhigh-dimensional datasets such as the whole human genome. On the other hand,\\ndeep neural network architectures (the core of deep learning) can better\\nexploit large-scale datasets to build complex models. In this paper, we use the\\nK-means clustering approach for scalable genomic data analysis aiming towards\\nclustering genotypic variants at the population scale. Finally, we train a deep\\nbelief network (DBN) for predicting the geographic ethnicity. We used the\\ngenotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project, which covers the result of genome\\nsequencing for 2504 individuals from 26 different ethnic origins and comprises\\n84 million variants.

Commonly, the\\nteacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student\\nis more compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the\\nstudent's compactness. %we desire a compact model with performance close to the\\nteacher's. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models,\\nwe train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly,\\nthese {Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly,\\nboth on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs\\nbased on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10\\n(3.5%) and CIFAR-100 (15.5%) datasets, by validation error. Additional\\nexperiments explore two distillation objectives: (i) Confidence-Weighted by\\nTeacher Max (CWTM) and (ii) Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP).\\nBoth methods elucidate the essential components of KD, demonstrating a role of\\nthe teacher outputs on both predicted and non-predicted classes.

In this paper, we present an IRL approach using dynamic audio-visual\\ninput in terms of vocal commands and hand gestures as feedback. Our\\narchitecture integrates multi-modal information to provide robust commands from\\nmultiple sensory cues along with a confidence value indicating the\\ntrustworthiness of the feedback. The integration process also considers the\\ncase in which the two modalities convey incongruent information. Additionally,\\nwe modulate the influence of sensory-driven feedback in the IRL task using\\ngoal-oriented knowledge in terms of contextual affordances. We implement a\\nneural network architecture to predict the effect of performed actions with\\ndifferent objects to avoid failed-states, i.e., states from which it is not\\npossible to accomplish the task. In our experimental setup, we explore the\\ninterplay of multimodal feedback and task-specific affordances in a robot\\ncleaning scenario. We compare the learning performance of the agent under four\\ndifferent conditions: traditional RL, multi-modal IRL, and each of these two\\nsetups with the use of contextual affordances. Our experiments show that the\\nbest performance is obtained by using audio-visual feedback with\\naffordancemodulated IRL. The obtained results demonstrate the importance of\\nmulti-modal sensory processing integrated with goal-oriented knowledge in IRL\\ntasks.\\n', '  The roles played by learning and memorization represent an important topic in\\ndeep learning research.

Here, we propose a novel\\npermutation approach that can differentiate memorization from learning in deep\\nneural networks (DNNs) trained as usual (i.e., using the real labels to guide\\nthe learning, rather than shuffled labels). The evaluation of weather the DNN\\nhas learned and/or memorized, happens in a separate step where we compare the\\npredictive performance of a shallow classifier trained with the features\\nlearned by the DNN, against multiple instances of the same classifier, trained\\non the same input, but using shuffled labels as outputs. By evaluating these\\nshallow classifiers in validation sets that share structure with the training\\nset, we are able to tell apart learning from memorization. Application of our\\npermutation approach to multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural\\nnetworks trained on image data corroborated many findings from other groups.\\nMost importantly, our illustrations also uncovered interesting dynamic patterns\\nabout how DNNs memorize over increasing numbers of training epochs, and support\\nthe surprising result that DNNs are still able to learn, rather than only\\nmemorize, when trained with pure Gaussian noise as input.\\n', '  Neural models have become ubiquitous in automatic speech recognition systems.\\nWhile neural networks are typically used as acoustic models in more complex\\nsystems, recent studies have explored end-to-end speech recognition systems\\nbased on neural networks, which can be trained to directly predict text from\\ninput acoustic features. Although such systems are conceptually elegant and\\nsimpler than traditional systems, it is less obvious how to interpret the\\ntrained models. In this work, we analyze the speech representations learned by\\na deep end-to-end model that is based on convolutional and recurrent layers,\\nand trained with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. We use a\\npre-trained model to generate frame-level features which are given to a\\nclassifier that is trained on frame classification into phones.

The proposed architecture\\nconsists of two branches of DCNNs to map the high and low resolution face\\nimages into a common space with nonlinear transformations. The branch\\ncorresponding to transformation of high resolution images consists of 14 layers\\nand the other branch which maps the low resolution face images to the common\\nspace includes a 5-layer super-resolution network connected to a 14-layer\\nnetwork. The distance between the features of corresponding high and low\\nresolution images are backpropagated to train the networks. Our proposed method\\nis evaluated on FERET data set and compared with state-of-the-art competing\\nmethods. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed method\\nsignificantly improves the recognition performance especially for very low\\nresolution probe face images (11.4% improvement in recognition accuracy).\\nFurthermore, it can reconstruct a high resolution image from its corresponding\\nlow resolution probe image which is comparable with state-of-the-art\\nsuper-resolution methods in terms of visual quality.\\n', '  Recurrent neural nets (RNN) and convolutional neural nets (CNN) are widely\\nused on NLP tasks to capture the long-term and local dependencies,\\nrespectively. Attention mechanisms have recently attracted enormous interest\\ndue to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training\\ntime, and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention\\nmechanism in which the attention between elements from input sequence(s) is\\ndirectional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wise). A light-weight neural\\nnet, \"Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)\", is then proposed to learn\\nsentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any RNN/CNN\\nstructure. DiSAN is only composed of a directional self-attention with temporal\\norder encoded, followed by a multi-dimensional attention that compresses the\\nsequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple form, DiSAN\\noutperforms complicated RNN models on both prediction quality and time\\nefficiency. It achieves the best test accuracy among all sentence encoding\\nmethods and improves the most recent best result by 1.02% on the Stanford\\nNatural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, and shows state-of-the-art test\\naccuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), Multi-Genre natural language\\ninference (MultiNLI), Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK),\\nCustomer Review, MPQA, TREC question-type classification and Subjectivity\\n(SUBJ) datasets.\\n', '  Advances in deep learning for natural images have prompted a surge of\\ninterest in applying similar techniques to medical images. The majority of the\\ninitial attempts focused on replacing the input of a deep convolutional neural\\nnetwork with a medical image, which does not take into consideration the\\nfundamental differences between these two types of images. Specifically, fine\\ndetails are necessary for detection in medical images, unlike in natural images\\nwhere coarse structures matter most. This difference makes it inadequate to use\\nthe existing network architectures developed for natural images, because they\\nwork on heavily downscaled images to reduce the memory requirements. This hides\\ndetails necessary to make accurate predictions. Additionally, a single exam in\\nmedical imaging often comes with a set of views which must be fused in order to\\nreach a correct conclusion. In our work, we propose to use a multi-view deep\\nconvolutional neural network that handles a set of high-resolution medical\\nimages. We evaluate it on large-scale mammography-based breast cancer screening\\n(BI-RADS prediction) using 886,000 images. We focus on investigating the impact\\nof the training set size and image size on the prediction accuracy. Our results\\nhighlight that performance increases with the size of training set, and that\\nthe best performance can only be achieved using the original resolution.

However, supervised training of SNNs remains a\\nchallenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training\\nmethods can basically be categorized into two classes, backpropagation-like\\ntraining methods and plasticity-based learning methods. The former methods are\\ndependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation and non-local\\ntransmission, as also required in artificial neural networks (ANNs), while the\\nlatter either be considered biologically implausible or exhibit poor\\nperformance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible) high-performance\\nsupervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In this paper, we\\nproposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the symmetric\\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in neuroscience. By\\ncombining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic scaling and intrinsic\\nplasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model implemented SL well and\\nachieved good performance in the benchmark recognition task (MNIST). To reveal\\nthe underlying mechanism of our SL model, we visualized both layer-based\\nactivities and synaptic weights using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor\\nembedding (t-SNE) method after training and found that they were well\\nclustered, thereby demonstrating excellent classification ability. As the\\nlearning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on local spike events, our\\nmodel could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware for online training and\\nmay be helpful for understanding SL information processing at the synaptic\\nlevel in biological neural systems.\\n', \"  This paper proposes a principled information theoretic analysis of\\nclassification for deep neural network structures, e.g. convolutional neural\\nnetworks (CNN). The output of convolutional filters is modeled as a random\\nvariable Y conditioned on the object class C and network filter bank F. The\\nconditional entropy (CENT) H(Y |C,F) is shown in theory and experiments to be a\\nhighly compact and class-informative code, that can be computed from the filter\\noutputs throughout an existing CNN and used to obtain higher classification\\nresults than the original CNN itself. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof CENT feature analysis in two separate CNN classification contexts. 1) In the\\nclassification of neurodegeneration due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and natural\\naging from 3D magnetic resonance image (MRI) volumes, 3 CENT features result in\\nan AUC=94.6% for whole-brain AD classification, the highest reported accuracy\\non the public OASIS dataset used and 12% higher than the softmax output of the\\noriginal CNN trained for the task. 2) In the context of visual object\\nclassification from 2D photographs, transfer learning based on a small set of\\nCENT features identified throughout an existing CNN leads to AUC values\\ncomparable to the 1000-feature softmax output of the original network when\\nclassifying previously unseen object categories.

We we\\nalso establish an evaluation protocol for natural-language visual detection.\\n', '  In this paper, a deep domain adaptation based method for video smoke\\ndetection is proposed to extract a powerful feature representation of smoke.\\nDue to the smoke image samples limited in scale and diversity for deep CNN\\ntraining, we systematically produced adequate synthetic smoke images with a\\nwide variation in the smoke shape, background and lighting conditions.\\nConsidering that the appearance gap (dataset bias) between synthetic and real\\nsmoke images degrades significantly the performance of the trained model on the\\ntest set composed fully of real images, we build deep architectures based on\\ndomain adaptation to confuse the distributions of features extracted from\\nsynthetic and real smoke images. This approach expands the domain-invariant\\nfeature space for smoke image samples. With their approximate feature\\ndistribution off non-smoke images, the recognition rate of the trained model is\\nimproved significantly compared to the model trained directly on mixed dataset\\nof synthetic and real images. Experimentally, several deep architectures with\\ndifferent design choices are applied to the smoke detector. The ultimate\\nframework can get a satisfactory result on the test set. We believe that our\\napproach is a start in the direction of utilizing deep neural networks enhanced\\nwith synthetic smoke images for video smoke detection.\\n', '  The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different\\nforms depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the\\nconceptual system. We propose that a compositional network model can be used to\\ncapture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g.,\\nBANANA, BOTTLE) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g.,\\nYELLOW, SWEET) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In\\nthis framework, networks capture the within-concept statistics that reflect how\\nproperties correlate with each other across instances of a concept. We ran a\\nclassification analysis using graph eigendecomposition to validate these\\nmodels, and find that these models can successfully discriminate between object\\nconcepts. We then computed formal measures from these concept networks and\\nexplored their relationship to conceptual structure. We find that diversity\\ncoefficients and core-periphery structure can be interpreted as network-based\\nmeasures of conceptual flexibility and stability, respectively. These results\\nsupport the feasibility of a concept network framework and highlight its\\nability to formally capture important characteristics of the conceptual system.\\n', '  We address the problem of \\\\emph{instance label stability} in multiple\\ninstance learning (MIL) classifiers. These classifiers are trained only on\\nglobally annotated images (bags), but often can provide fine-grained\\nannotations for image pixels or patches (instances).

This means that a slight change in training data could potentially\\nlead to abnormalities being detected in different parts of the image, which is\\nundesirable from a CAD point of view. Despite MIL gaining popularity in the CAD\\nliterature, this issue has not yet been addressed. We investigate the stability\\nof instance labels provided by several MIL classifiers on 5 different datasets,\\nof which 3 are medical image datasets (breast histopathology, diabetic\\nretinopathy and computed tomography lung images). We propose an unsupervised\\nmeasure to evaluate instance stability, and demonstrate that a\\nperformance-stability trade-off can be made when comparing MIL classifiers.\\n', '  Diagnosis and risk stratification of cancer and many other diseases require\\nthe detection of genomic breakpoints as a prerequisite of calling copy number\\nalterations (CNA).

As deep-learning methods outperformed classical\\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in various domains and have also been successfully\\napplied to life science problems including medicine and biology, we here\\npropose Deep SNP, a novel Deep Neural Network to learn from genomic data.\\nSpecifically, we used a manually curated dataset from 12 genomic single\\nnucleotide polymorphism array (SNPa) profiles as truth-set and aimed at\\npredicting the presence or absence of genomic breakpoints, an indicator of\\nstructural chromosomal variations, in windows of 40,000 probes.

We show, that Deep SNP is capable of successfully predicting\\nthe presence or absence of a breakpoint in large genomic windows and\\noutperforms state-of-the-art neural network models. Qualitative examples\\nsuggest that integration of a localization unit may enable breakpoint detection\\nand prediction of genomic segments, even if the breakpoint coordinates were not\\nprovided for network training. These results warrant further evaluation of\\nDeepSNP for breakpoint localization and subsequent calling of genomic segments.\\n', '  Accurately predicting and detecting interstitial lung disease (ILD) patterns\\ngiven any computed tomography (CT) slice without any pre-processing\\nprerequisites, such as manually delineated regions of interest (ROIs), is a\\nclinically desirable, yet challenging goal. The majority of existing work\\nrelies on manually-provided ILD ROIs to extract sampled 2D image patches from\\nCT slices and, from there, performs patch-based ILD categorization. Acquiring\\nmanual ROIs is labor intensive and serves as a bottleneck towards\\nfully-automated CT imaging ILD screening over large-scale populations.\\nFurthermore, despite the considerable high frequency of more than one ILD\\npattern on a single CT slice, previous works are only designed to detect one\\nILD pattern per slice or patch.\\nTo tackle these two critical challenges, we present multi-label deep\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting ILDs from holistic CT slices\\n(instead of ROIs or sub-images).

Our\\nmethods are evaluated and validated using a publicly available database of 658\\npatient CT scans under five-fold cross-validation, achieving promising\\nperformance on detecting four major ILD patterns: Ground Glass, Reticular,\\nHoneycomb, and Emphysema. We also investigate the effectiveness of a CNN\\nactivation-based deep-feature encoding scheme using Fisher vector encoding,\\nwhich treats ILD detection as spatially-unordered deep texture classification.\\n', '  This paper considers the challenging task of long-term video interpolation.\\nUnlike most existing methods that only generate few intermediate frames between\\nexisting adjacent ones, we attempt to speculate or imagine the procedure of an\\nepisode and further generate multiple frames between two non-consecutive frames\\nin videos. In this paper, we present a novel deep architecture called\\nbidirectional predictive network (BiPN) that predicts intermediate frames from\\ntwo opposite directions. The bidirectional architecture allows the model to\\nlearn scene transformation with time as well as generate longer video\\nsequences. Besides, our model can be extended to predict multiple possible\\nprocedures by sampling different noise vectors. A joint loss composed of clues\\nin image and feature spaces and adversarial loss is designed to train our\\nmodel. We demonstrate the advantages of BiPN on two benchmarks Moving 2D Shapes\\nand UCF101 and report competitive results to recent approaches.\\n', \"  In this project, we propose a novel approach for estimating depth from RGB\\nimages. Traditionally, most work uses a single RGB image to estimate depth,\\nwhich is inherently difficult and generally results in poor performance, even\\nwith thousands of data examples. In this work, we alternatively use multiple\\nRGB images that were captured while changing the focus of the camera's lens.\\nThis method leverages the natural depth information correlated to the different\\npatterns of clarity/blur in the sequence of focal images, which helps\\ndistinguish objects at different depths. Since no such data set exists for\\nlearning this mapping, we collect our own data set using customized hardware.\\nWe then use a convolutional neural network for learning the depth from the\\nstacked focal images. Comparative studies were conducted on both a standard\\nRGBD data set and our own data set (learning from both single and multiple\\nimages), and results verified that stacked focal images yield better depth\\nestimation than using just single RGB image.\\n\", '  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as a popular\\nbuilding block for natural language processing (NLP). Despite their success,\\nmost existing CNN models employed in NLP share the same learned (and static)\\nset of filters for all input sentences. In this paper, we consider an approach\\nof using a small meta network to learn context-sensitive convolutional filters\\nfor text processing. The role of meta network is to abstract the contextual\\ninformation of a sentence or document into a set of input-aware filters. We\\nfurther generalize this framework to model sentence pairs, where a\\nbidirectional filter generation mechanism is introduced to encapsulate\\nco-dependent sentence representations. In our benchmarks on four different\\ntasks, including ontology classification, sentiment analysis, answer sentence\\nselection, and paraphrase identification, our proposed model, a modified CNN\\nwith context-sensitive filters, consistently outperforms the standard CNN and\\nattention-based CNN baselines. By visualizing the learned context-sensitive\\nfilters, we further validate and rationalize the effectiveness of proposed\\nframework.\\n', '  Deep neural networks (DNN) excel at extracting patterns.

Thereby, neglecting the distributed spatial patterns\\nof brain activity underlying many cognitive states. In this work, we introduce\\nthe DLight framework, which overcomes these challenges by utilizing a long\\nshort-term memory unit (LSTM) based deep neural network architecture to analyze\\nthe spatial dependency structure of whole-brain fMRI data. In order to maintain\\ninterpretability of the neuroimaging data, we adapt the layer-wise relevance\\npropagation (LRP) method. Thereby, we enable the neuroscientist user to study\\nthe learned association of the LSTM between the data and the cognitive state of\\nthe individual. We demonstrate the versatility of DLight by applying it to a\\nlarge fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that the decoding\\nperformance of our method scales better with large datasets, and moreover\\noutperforms conventional decoding approaches, while still detecting\\nphysiologically appropriate brain areas for the cognitive states classified. We\\nalso demonstrate that DLight is able to detect these areas on several levels of\\ndata granularity (i.e., group, subject, trial, time point).\\n', '  With the proliferation of social media, fashion inspired from celebrities,\\nreputed designers as well as fashion influencers has shortened the cycle of\\nfashion design and manufacturing. However, with the explosion of fashion\\nrelated content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an\\narduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and\\ncreate a digest of trending fashion. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion\\nphotos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a\\ngiven fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have\\nthousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult\\nto get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover,\\nstate-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large\\namount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object\\ndetectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic\\nobject detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24\\ncategories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the\\nbase architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K\\nunlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then\\nsubsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset.\\nOn 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K\\nphotos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art\\nobject detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of\\narchitecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs\\nsignificantly better in identifying small objects.\\n', '  Despite rapid advances in face recognition, there remains a clear gap between\\nthe performance of still image-based face recognition and video-based face\\nrecognition, due to the vast difference in visual quality between the domains\\nand the difficulty of curating diverse large-scale video datasets. This paper\\naddresses both of those challenges, through an image to video feature-level\\ndomain adaptation approach, to learn discriminative video frame\\nrepresentations. The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to\\nreduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative\\nknowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition\\nnetwork that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by\\n(i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through\\nfeature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data\\naugmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain\\nadversarial discriminator. We further improve performance through a\\ndiscriminator-guided feature fusion that boosts high-quality frames while\\neliminating those degraded by video domain-specific factors. Experiments on the\\nYouTube Faces and IJB-A datasets demonstrate that each module contributes to\\nour feature-level domain adaptation framework and substantially improves video\\nface recognition performance to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. We\\ndemonstrate qualitatively that the network learns to suppress diverse artifacts\\nin videos such as pose, illumination or occlusion without being explicitly\\ntrained for them.\\n', '  We propose a Label Propagation based algorithm for weakly supervised text\\nclassification. We construct a graph where each document is represented by a\\nnode and edge weights represent similarities among the documents. Additionally,\\nwe discover underlying topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and\\nenrich the document graph by including the topics in the form of additional\\nnodes. The edge weights between a topic and a text document represent level of\\n\"affinity\" between them. Our approach does not require document level\\nlabelling, instead it expects manual labels only for topic nodes. This\\nsignificantly minimizes the level of supervision needed as only a few topics\\nare observed to be enough for achieving sufficiently high accuracy. The Label\\nPropagation Algorithm is employed on this enriched graph to propagate labels\\namong the nodes. Our approach combines the advantages of Label Propagation\\n(through document-document similarities) and Topic Modelling (for minimal but\\nsmart supervision). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various\\ndatasets and compare with state-of-the-art weakly supervised text\\nclassification approaches.\\n', '  Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an\\nalternative, computational prediction of protein function has received\\nattention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help,\\nby allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified\\nproteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins\\nwith similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on\\nsequence-based or direct (\"raw\") 3-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein\\nfeatures. In contrast, we first model 3D structures as protein structure\\nnetworks (PSNs). Then, we use (\"processed\") network-based features for PSC. We\\npropose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many domains of\\nnetwork science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only\\nwith unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing\\nPSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that\\nautomatically learns network features from the weighted PSNs. When evaluated on\\na large set of ~9,400 CATH and ~12,800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN\\nsets), our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms\\nof accuracy, with comparable running time.\\n', '  Global Style Tokens (GSTs) are a recently-proposed method to learn latent\\ndisentangled representations of high-dimensional data.

While some tasks deal\\nwith identifying the presence of sentiment in the text (Subjectivity analysis),\\nother tasks aim at determining the polarity of the text categorizing them as\\npositive, negative and neutral. Whenever there is a presence of sentiment in\\nthe text, it has a source (people, group of people or any entity) and the\\nsentiment is directed towards some entity, object, event or person. Sentiment\\nanalysis tasks aim to determine the subject, the target and the polarity or\\nvalence of the sentiment. In our work, we try to automatically extract\\nsentiment (positive or negative) from Facebook posts using a machine learning\\napproach.While some works have been done in code-mixed social media data and in\\nsentiment analysis separately, our work is the first attempt (as of now) which\\naims at performing sentiment analysis of code-mixed social media text.

The problem is unsupervised due to lack of\\nparallel data in practice, and is challenging to minimally yet effectively\\nmanipulate the text (by rewriting/adding/deleting text portions) to ensure\\nfidelity to the structured content. We derive a dataset from a basketball game\\nreport corpus as our testbed, and develop a neural method with unsupervised\\ncompeting objectives and explicit content coverage constraints. Automatic and\\nhuman evaluations show superiority of our approach over competitive methods\\nincluding a strong rule-based baseline and prior approaches designed for style\\ntransfer.\\n\", '  Social learning, i.e., students learning from each other through social\\ninteractions, has the potential to significantly scale up instruction in online\\neducation. In many cases, such as in massive open online courses (MOOCs),\\nsocial learning is facilitated through discussion forums hosted by course\\nproviders. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for the process of\\nlearners posting on such forums, using point processes. Different from existing\\nworks, our method integrates topic modeling of the post text, timescale\\nmodeling of the decay in post activity over time, and learner topic interest\\nmodeling into a single model, and infers this information from user data.

Methods: In this paper, we present the implementation of Cohort\\nRetrieval Enhanced by Analysis of Text from EHRs (CREATE), a cohort retrieval\\nsystem that can execute textual cohort selection queries on both structured and\\nunstructured EHR data. CREATE is a proof-of-concept system that leverages a\\ncombination of structured queries and IR techniques on NLP results to improve\\ncohort retrieval performance while adopting the Observational Medical Outcomes\\nPartnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to enhance model portability. The\\nNLP component empowered by cTAKES is used to extract CDM concepts from textual\\nqueries.

However, unlike human perception,\\ncurrent DRL models connect the entire low-level sensory input to the\\nstate-action values rather than exploiting the relationship between and among\\nentities that constitute the sensory input. Because of this difference, DRL\\nneeds vast amount of experience samples to learn. In this paper, we propose a\\nMulti-focus Attention Network (MANet) which mimics human ability to spatially\\nabstract the low-level sensory input into multiple entities and attend to them\\nsimultaneously. The proposed method first divides the low-level input into\\nseveral segments which we refer to as partial states. After this segmentation,\\nparallel attention layers attend to the partial states relevant to solving the\\ntask. Our model estimates state-action values using these attended partial\\nstates. In our experiments, MANet attains highest scores with significantly\\nless experience samples. Additionally, the model shows higher performance\\ncompared to the Deep Q-network and the single attention model as benchmarks.\\nFurthermore, we extend our model to attentive communication model for\\nperforming multi-agent cooperative tasks.

The feature learning framework is designed to extract\\nlow- and mid-level features. Low-level features capture temporal and frequency\\ndomain properties and mid-level features learn compositions and structural\\ninformation of signals. Since sleep staging is a sequential problem with\\nlong-term dependencies, we take advantage of RNNs with Bidirectional Long\\nShort-Term Memory (BLSTM) architectures for sequence data learning. To simulate\\nthe actual situation of daily sleep, experiments are conducted with a resting\\ngroup in which sleep is recorded in resting state, and a comprehensive group in\\nwhich both resting sleep and non-resting sleep are included.We evaluate the\\nalgorithm based on an eight-fold cross validation to classify five sleep stages\\n(W, N1, N2, N3, and REM).

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary\\ngenerative adversarial networks (E-GAN) for stable GAN training and improved\\ngenerative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a pre-defined\\nadversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a\\ndiscriminator, we utilize different adversarial training objectives as mutation\\noperations and evolve a population of generators to adapt to the environment\\n(i.e., the discriminator). We also utilize an evaluation mechanism to measure\\nthe quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing\\ngenerator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN\\novercomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and\\nalways preserves the best offspring, contributing to progress in and the\\nsuccess of GANs.

Unlike previous works\\nwith similar approaches, we do not extract the embedding of an utterance from\\nthe mean reduction of the temporal dimension. Our system replaces the mean by a\\nphrase alignment model to keep the temporal structure of each phrase which is\\nrelevant in this application since the phonetic information is part of the\\nidentity in the verification task. Moreover, we can apply a convolutional\\nneural network as front-end, and thanks to the alignment process being\\ndifferentiable, we can train the whole network to produce a supervector for\\neach utterance which will be discriminative with respect to the speaker and the\\nphrase simultaneously. As we show, this choice has the advantage that the\\nsupervector encodes the phrase and speaker information providing good\\nperformance in text-dependent speaker verification tasks. In this work, the\\nprocess of verification is performed using a basic similarity metric, due to\\nsimplicity, compared to other more elaborate models that are commonly used.

Identifying these spammers and the spam content is a hot topic of\\nresearch and although a considerable number of studies have been done recently\\ntoward this end, but so far the methodologies put forth still barely detect\\nspam reviews, and none of them show the importance of each extracted feature\\ntype. In this study, we propose a novel framework, named NetSpam, which\\nutilizes spam features for modeling review datasets as heterogeneous\\ninformation networks to map spam detection procedure into a classification\\nproblem in such networks. Using the importance of spam features help us to\\nobtain better results in terms of different metrics experimented on real-world\\nreview datasets from Yelp and Amazon websites.

The proposed semi-supervised\\nlearning decodes the unlabeled large training corpus using the seed model and\\nthrough various protocols, selects the decoded utterances with high reliability\\nusing confidence levels (that correlate to the WER of the decoded utterances)\\nand iterative bootstrapping. The proposed active learning protocol uses\\nconfidence level based metric to select the decoded utterances from the large\\nunlabeled corpus for further labeling. The semi-supervised learning protocols\\ncan offer a WER reduction, from a poorly trained seed model, by as much as 50%\\nof the best WER-reduction realizable from the seed model's WER, if the large\\ncorpus were labeled and used for acoustic-model training.

However, transferring to a\\ntarget domain with significant domain shifts but no paired training data\\n(referred to as cross-domain image captioning) remains largely unexplored. We\\npropose a novel adversarial training procedure to leverage unpaired data in the\\ntarget domain. Two critic networks are introduced to guide the captioner,\\nnamely domain critic and multi-modal critic. The domain critic assesses whether\\nthe generated sentences are indistinguishable from sentences in the target\\ndomain. The multi-modal critic assesses whether an image and its generated\\nsentence are a valid pair. During training, the critics and captioner act as\\nadversaries -- captioner aims to generate indistinguishable sentences, whereas\\ncritics aim at distinguishing them. The assessment improves the captioner\\nthrough policy gradient updates. During inference, we further propose a novel\\ncritic-based planning method to select high-quality sentences without\\nadditional supervision (e.g., tags). To evaluate, we use MSCOCO as the source\\ndomain and four other datasets (CUB-200-2011, Oxford-102, TGIF, and Flickr30k)\\nas the target domains. Our method consistently performs well on all datasets.\\nIn particular, on CUB-200-2011, we achieve 21.8% CIDEr-D improvement after\\nadaptation.

In the static declaration strategy\\nthat is used in toolkits like Theano, CNTK, and TensorFlow, the user first\\ndefines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation), and\\nthen examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and\\ncomputes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation\\ngraph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by\\nexecuting procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is\\nfree to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration\\nthus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures,\\nand DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in\\na way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or\\nPython). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic\\ncomputation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction\\nmust have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and\\nlightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet's speeds are\\nfaster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits, and significantly\\nfaster than Chainer, another dynamic declaration toolkit.

In this\\nwork, we study and compare the performance of DNN and EVF features for the\\npurpose of physical artwork recommendation using transactional data from\\nUGallery, an online store of physical paintings. In addition, we perform an\\nexploratory analysis to understand if DNN embedded features have some relation\\nwith certain EVF.

In this paper, we\\npropose a joint deep network model that combines adversarial training and\\nperceptual feature regression for texture generation, while only random noise\\nand user-defined perceptual attributes are required as input. In this model, a\\npreliminary trained convolutional neural network is essentially integrated with\\nthe adversarial framework, which can drive the generated textures to possess\\ngiven perceptual attributes. An important aspect of the proposed model is that,\\nif we change one of the input perceptual features, the corresponding appearance\\nof the generated textures will also be changed. We design several experiments\\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the\\nproposed method can produce high quality texture images with desired perceptual\\nproperties.\\n', '  While going deeper has been witnessed to improve the performance of\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), going smaller for CNN has received\\nincreasing attention recently due to its attractiveness for mobile/embedded\\napplications. It remains an active and important topic how to design a small\\nnetwork while retaining the performance of large and deep CNNs (e.g., Inception\\nNets, ResNets). Albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the\\nsize of CNNs, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in\\nmany designs. This paper addresses this concern with several new contributions.\\nFirst, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep\\nCNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most\\nprevious work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different\\ntreatments of $1\\\\times 1$ convolutions and $k\\\\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$),\\nwhere we only binarize $k\\\\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. The\\nresulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show\\nthat previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be\\ncompressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of\\nthe different functionalities of $1\\\\times 1$ (data projection/transformation)\\nand $k\\\\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block\\nstructure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature\\nmaps generated by $1\\\\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps\\ngenerated by $k\\\\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network\\nwith $\\\\sim 1$ million parameters. Combining with our parameter binarization, we\\nachieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks\\nincluding recently released Google MobileNets.\\n', '  Deep learning (DL) has recently achieved tremendous success in a variety of\\ncutting-edge applications, e.g., image recognition, speech and natural language\\nprocessing, and autonomous driving. Besides the available big data and hardware\\nevolution, DL frameworks and platforms play a key role to catalyze the\\nresearch, development, and deployment of DL intelligent solutions. However, the\\ndifference in computation paradigm, architecture design and implementation of\\nexisting DL frameworks and platforms brings challenges for DL software\\ndevelopment, deployment, maintenance, and migration. Up to the present, it\\nstill lacks a comprehensive study on how current diverse DL frameworks and\\nplatforms influence the DL software development process.\\nIn this paper, we initiate the first step towards the investigation on how\\nexisting state-of-the-art DL frameworks (i.e., TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch)\\nand platforms (i.e., server/desktop, web, and mobile) support the DL software\\ndevelopment activities. We perform an in-depth and comparative evaluation on\\nmetrics such as learning accuracy, DL model size, robustness, and performance,\\non state-of-the-art DL frameworks across platforms using two popular datasets\\nMNIST and CIFAR-10.

To ignite further\\ninvestigation along this direction to address urgent industrial demands of\\nintelligent solutions, we make all of our assembled feasible toolchain and\\ndataset publicly available.\\n', '  Temporal object detection has attracted significant attention, but most\\npopular detection methods can not leverage the rich temporal information in\\nvideos. Very recently, many different algorithms have been developed for video\\ndetection task, but real-time online approaches are frequently deficient. In\\nthis paper, based on attention mechanism and convolutional long short-term\\nmemory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal signal-shot detector (TSSD) for\\nreal-world detection. Distinct from previous methods, we take aim at temporally\\nintegrating pyramidal feature hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a novel\\nstructure including a low-level temporal unit as well as a high-level one\\n(HL-TU) for multi-scale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal\\nanalysis unit, namely, attentional ConvLSTM (AC-LSTM), in which a temporal\\nattention module is specially tailored for background suppression and scale\\nsuppression while a ConvLSTM integrates attention-aware features through time.\\nAn association loss is designed for temporal coherence. Besides, online tubelet\\nanalysis (OTA) is exploited for identification. Finally, our method is\\nevaluated on ImageNet VID dataset and 2DMOT15 dataset. Extensive comparisons on\\nthe detection and tracking capability validate the superiority of the proposed\\napproach. Consequently, the developed TSSD-OTA is fairly faster and achieves an\\noverall competitive performance in terms of detection and tracking.

We account for\\nthe temporal ordering of documents by explicitly modeling a joint distribution\\nof latent topical dependencies over time, using distributional estimators with\\ntemporal recurrent connections. Applying RNN-RSM to 19 years of articles on NLP\\nresearch, we demonstrate that compared to state-of-the art topic models, RNNRSM\\nshows better generalization, topic interpretation, evolution and trends. We\\nalso introduce a metric (named as SPAN) to quantify the capability of dynamic\\ntopic model to capture word evolution in topics over time.\\n', '  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with sophisticated units that implement a\\ngating mechanism have emerged as powerful technique for modeling sequential\\nsignals such as speech or electroencephalography (EEG).

The convolutional LSTM\\narchitecture with proper initialization and regularization delivers 30%\\nsensitivity at 6 false alarms per 24 hours.\\n', '  This paper is concerned with paraphrase detection. The ability to detect\\nsimilar sentences written in natural language is crucial for several\\napplications, such as text mining, text summarization, plagiarism detection,\\nauthorship authentication and question answering.

Recently, two\\ncompeting approaches for automatic program learning have received significant\\nattention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned\\non input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural\\nprogram induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using\\na latent program representation.\\nHere, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a\\nlarge-scale, real-world learning task. We additionally contrast to rule-based\\nprogram synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program\\ngeneration. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of\\nvariable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92%\\naccuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous\\nbest neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a\\ncomparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate\\nthat the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric\\nand end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models\\nto remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g.,\\ntypos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.\\n', \"  Bots, social media accounts controlled by software rather than by humans,\\nhave recently been under the spotlight for their association with various forms\\nof online manipulation. To date, much work has focused on social bot detection,\\nbut little attention has been devoted to the characterization and measurement\\nof the behavior and activity of bots, as opposed to humans'. Over the course of\\nthe years, bots have become more sophisticated, and capable to reflect some\\nshort-term behavior, emulating that of human users. The goal of this paper is\\nto study the behavioral dynamics that bots exhibit over the course of one\\nactivity session, and highlight if and how these differ from human activity\\nsignatures. By using a large Twitter dataset associated with recent political\\nevents, we first separate bots and humans, then isolate their activity\\nsessions. We compile a list of quantities to be measured, like the propensity\\nof users to engage in social interactions or to produce content. Our analysis\\nhighlights the presence of short-term behavioral trends in humans, which can be\\nassociated with a cognitive origin, that are absent in bots, intuitively due to\\ntheir automated activity. These findings are finally codified to create and\\nevaluate a machine learning algorithm to detect activity sessions produced by\\nbots and humans, to allow for more nuanced bot detection strategies.\\n\", '  Text representations using neural word embeddings have proven effective in\\nmany NLP applications. Recent researches adapt the traditional word embedding\\nmodels to learn vectors of multiword expressions (concepts/entities). However,\\nthese methods are limited to textual knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia). In this\\npaper, we propose a novel and simple technique for integrating the knowledge\\nabout concepts from two large scale knowledge bases of different structure\\n(Wikipedia and Probase) in order to learn concept representations. We adapt the\\nefficient skip-gram model to seamlessly learn from the knowledge in Wikipedia\\ntext and Probase concept graph. We evaluate our concept embedding models on two\\ntasks: (1) analogical reasoning, where we achieve a state-of-the-art\\nperformance of 91% on semantic analogies, (2) concept categorization, where we\\nachieve a state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets achieving\\ncategorization accuracy of 100% on one and 98% on the other. Additionally, we\\npresent a case study to evaluate our model on unsupervised argument type\\nidentification for neural semantic parsing. We demonstrate the competitive\\naccuracy of our unsupervised method and its ability to better generalize to out\\nof vocabulary entity mentions compared to the tedious and error prone methods\\nwhich depend on gazetteers and regular expressions.\\n', \"  Opinion polls have been the bridge between public opinion and politicians in\\nelections.

We proposed a method for on-the-fly construction and\\nexploitation of word embeddings in both the input and output layers of a neural\\nmodel by tracking contexts. This extends the dynamic entity representation used\\nin Kobayashi et al. (2016) and incorporates a copy mechanism proposed\\nindependently by Gu et al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. (2016). In addition, we\\nconstruct a new task and dataset called Anonymized Language Modeling for\\nevaluating the ability to capture word meanings while reading. Experiments\\nconducted using our novel dataset show that the proposed variant of RNN\\nlanguage model outperformed the baseline model. Furthermore, the experiments\\nalso demonstrate that dynamic updates of an output layer help a model predict\\nreappearing entities, whereas those of an input layer are effective to predict\\nwords following reappearing entities.\\n', '  With the spreading prevalence of Big Data, many advances have recently been\\nmade in this field. Frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark have\\ngained a lot of traction over the past decades and have become massively\\npopular, especially in industries. It is becoming increasingly evident that\\neffective big data analysis is key to solving artificial intelligence problems.\\nThus, a multi-algorithm library was implemented in the Spark framework, called\\nMLlib. While this library supports multiple machine learning algorithms, there\\nis still scope to use the Spark setup efficiently for highly time-intensive and\\ncomputationally expensive procedures like deep learning. In this paper, we\\npropose a novel framework that combines the distributive computational\\nabilities of Apache Spark and the advanced machine learning architecture of a\\ndeep multi-layer perceptron (MLP), using the popular concept of Cascade\\nLearning.

A major approach to achieve this objective is to train a model that\\nintegrates all the information of different modalities into a joint\\nrepresentation and then to generate one modality from the corresponding other\\nmodality via this joint representation. We simply applied this approach to\\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), which we call a joint multimodal variational\\nautoencoder (JMVAE). However, we found that when this model attempts to\\ngenerate a large dimensional modality missing at the input, the joint\\nrepresentation collapses and this modality cannot be generated successfully.\\nFurthermore, we confirmed that this difficulty cannot be resolved even using a\\nknown solution. Therefore, in this study, we propose two models to prevent this\\ndifficulty: JMVAE-kl and JMVAE-h. Results of our experiments demonstrate that\\nthese methods can prevent the difficulty above and that they generate\\nmodalities bi-directionally with equal or higher likelihood than conventional\\nVAE methods, which generate in only one direction. Moreover, we confirm that\\nthese methods can obtain the joint representation appropriately, so that they\\ncan generate various variations of modality by moving over the joint\\nrepresentation or changing the value of another modality.\\n', '  Over recent years, emerging interest has occurred in integrating computer\\nvision technology into the retail industry. Automatic checkout (ACO) is one of\\nthe critical problems in this area which aims to automatically generate the\\nshopping list from the images of the products to purchase. The main challenge\\nof this problem comes from the large scale and the fine-grained nature of the\\nproduct categories as well as the difficulty for collecting training images\\nthat reflect the realistic checkout scenarios due to continuous update of the\\nproducts. Despite its significant practical and research value, this problem is\\nnot extensively studied in the computer vision community, largely due to the\\nlack of a high-quality dataset. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new\\ndataset to facilitate relevant research. Our dataset enjoys the following\\ncharacteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of both product\\nimage quantity and product categories. (2) It includes single-product images\\ntaken in a controlled environment and multi-product images taken by the\\ncheckout system. (3) It provides different levels of annotations for the\\ncheck-out images. Comparing with the existing datasets, ours is closer to the\\nrealistic setting and can derive a variety of research problems.

Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP\\nsystems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and\\nimproves the performance of parsers, semantic role labellers and machine\\ntranslation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading\\ndisabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter\\nones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we\\ncreate and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tuples mapping a\\nsingle complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning.\\nSecond, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to\\nsemantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed\\ntask.\\n', '  We present a novel approach for the prediction of anticancer compound\\nsensitivity by means of multi-modal attention-based neural networks (PaccMann).\\nIn our approach, we integrate three key pillars of drug sensitivity, namely,\\nthe molecular structure of compounds, transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells\\nas well as prior knowledge about interactions among proteins within cells. Our\\nmodels ingest a drug-cell pair consisting of SMILES encoding of a compound and\\nthe gene expression profile of a cancer cell and predicts an IC50 sensitivity\\nvalue.

We compare our devised\\nmodels against a baseline model that ingests engineered fingerprints to\\nrepresent the molecular structure.

The use of\\nattention-based encoders enhance interpretability and enable us to identify\\ngenes, bonds and atoms that were used by the network to make a prediction.\\n', '  Large-scale variations still pose a challenge in unconstrained face\\ndetection. To the best of our knowledge, no current face detection algorithm\\ncan detect a face as large as 800 x 800 pixels while simultaneously detecting\\nanother one as small as 8 x 8 pixels within a single image with equally high\\naccuracy. We propose a two-stage cascaded face detection framework, Multi-Path\\nRegion-based Convolutional Neural Network (MP-RCNN), that seamlessly combines a\\ndeep neural network with a classic learning strategy, to tackle this challenge.\\nThe first stage is a Multi-Path Region Proposal Network (MP-RPN) that proposes\\nfaces at three different scales. It simultaneously utilizes three parallel\\noutputs of the convolutional feature maps to predict multi-scale candidate face\\nregions. The \"atrous\" convolution trick (convolution with up-sampled filters)\\nand a newly proposed sampling layer for \"hard\" examples are embedded in MP-RPN\\nto further boost its performance. The second stage is a Boosted Forests\\nclassifier, which utilizes deep facial features pooled from inside the\\ncandidate face regions as well as deep contextual features pooled from a larger\\nregion surrounding the candidate face regions. This step is included to further\\nremove hard negative samples. Experiments show that this approach achieves\\nstate-of-the-art face detection performance on the WIDER FACE dataset \"hard\"\\npartition, outperforming the former best result by 9.6% for the Average\\nPrecision.\\n', '  Knights Landing (KNL) is the code name for the second-generation Intel Xeon\\nPhi product family.

At the Lincoln Laboratory\\nSupercomputing Center (LLSC), the majority of users are running data analysis\\napplications such as MATLAB and Octave. More recently, machine learning\\napplications, such as the UC Berkeley Caffe deep learning framework, have\\nbecome increasingly important to LLSC users. Thus, the performance of these\\napplications on KNL systems is of high interest to LLSC users and the broader\\ndata analysis and machine learning communities. Our data analysis benchmarks of\\nthese application on the Intel KNL processor indicate that single-core\\ndouble-precision generalized matrix multiply (DGEMM) performance on KNL systems\\nhas improved by ~3.5x compared to prior Intel Xeon technologies.

ADaPTION\\nincludes tools to measure the dynamic range of weights and activations. Using\\nthe ADaPTION tools, we quantized several CNNs including VGG16 down to 16-bit\\nweights and activations with only 0.8% drop in Top-1 accuracy. The\\nquantization, especially of the activations, leads to increase of up to 50% of\\nsparsity especially in early and intermediate layers, which we exploit to skip\\nmultiplications with zero, thus performing faster and computationally cheaper\\ninference.\\n', \"  We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network\\narchitectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked\\nself-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on\\ngraph convolutions or their approximations.

In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools\\nboth the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the\\ndetector that counteracts this attack.\\n', '  Our work presented in this paper focuses on the translation of terminological\\nexpressions represented in semantically structured resources, like ontologies\\nor knowledge graphs. The challenge of translating ontology labels or\\nterminological expressions represented in knowledge bases lies in the highly\\nspecific vocabulary and the lack of contextual information, which can guide a\\nmachine translation system to translate ambiguous words into the targeted\\ndomain. Due to these challenges, we evaluate the translation quality of\\ndomain-specific expressions in the medical and financial domain with\\nstatistical (SMT) as well as with neural machine translation (NMT) methods and\\nexperiment domain adaptation of the translation models with terminological\\nexpressions only. Furthermore, we perform experiments on the injection of\\nexternal terminological expressions into the translation systems.

We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN\\narchitectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and\\nCelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by\\nattaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model,\\nwhich can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our\\nsecond attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target\\nreconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves\\nbeyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and\\ndirectly optimizes against differences in source and target latent\\nrepresentations.

Although most recent\\naction recognition methods are based on Recurrent Neural Networks which present\\noutstanding performance, one of the shortcomings of these methods is the\\ntendency to overemphasize the temporal information. Since 3D convolutional\\nneural network(3D CNN) is a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from\\nboth spatial and temporal dimensions through capturing the correlations between\\nthree dimensional signals, this paper proposes a novel two-stream model using\\n3D CNN.

Weak\\nlabels indicating whether a radiograph is likely to contain pulmonary nodules\\nare typically easier to obtain at scale by parsing historical free-text\\nradiological reports associated to the radiographs. Using a repositotory of\\nover 700,000 chest radiographs, in this study we demonstrate that promising\\nnodule detection performance can be achieved using weak labels through\\nconvolutional neural networks for radiograph classification. We propose two\\nnetwork architectures for the classification of images likely to contain\\npulmonary nodules using both weak labels and manually-delineated bounding\\nboxes, when these are available. Annotated nodules are used at training time to\\ndeliver a visual attention mechanism informing the model about its localisation\\nperformance.

This\\nwork develops a quantitative approach to characterize model compression\\ntechniques on a representative embedded deep learning architecture, the NVIDIA\\nJetson Tx2. We perform extensive experiments by considering 11 influential\\nneural network architectures from the image classification and the natural\\nlanguage processing domains. We experimentally show that how two mainstream\\ncompression techniques, data quantization and pruning, perform on these network\\narchitectures and the implications of compression techniques to the model\\nstorage size, inference time, energy consumption and performance metrics. We\\ndemonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve fast deep inference on\\nembedded systems, but one must carefully choose the compression settings. Our\\nresults provide insights on when and how to apply model compression techniques\\nand guidelines for designing efficient embedded deep learning systems.\\n', '  Face detection methods have relied on face datasets for training. However,\\nexisting face datasets tend to be in small scales for face learning in both\\nconstrained and unconstrained environments. In this paper, we first introduce\\nour large-scale image datasets, Large-scale Labeled Face (LSLF) and noisy\\nLarge-scale Labeled Non-face (LSLNF). Our LSLF dataset consists of a large\\nnumber of unconstrained multi-view and partially occluded faces. The faces have\\nmany variations in color and grayscale, image quality, image resolution, image\\nillumination, image background, image illusion, human face, cartoon face,\\nfacial expression, light and severe partial facial occlusion, make up, gender,\\nage, and race. Many of these faces are partially occluded with accessories such\\nas tattoos, hats, glasses, sunglasses, hands, hair, beards, scarves,\\nmicrophones, or other objects or persons. The LSLF dataset is currently the\\nlargest labeled face image dataset in the literature in terms of the number of\\nlabeled images and the number of individuals compared to other existing labeled\\nface image datasets. Second, we introduce our CrowedFaces and CrowedNonFaces\\nimage datasets. The crowedFaces and CrowedNonFaces datasets include faces and\\nnon-faces images from crowed scenes. These datasets essentially aim for\\nresearchers to provide a large number of training examples with many variations\\nfor large scale face learning and face recognition tasks.\\n', '  Sequence-to-sequence models provide a simple and elegant solution for\\nbuilding speech recognition systems by folding separate components of a typical\\nsystem, namely acoustic (AM), pronunciation (PM) and language (LM) models into\\na single neural network. In this work, we look at one such sequence-to-sequence\\nmodel, namely listen, attend and spell (LAS), and explore the possibility of\\ntraining a single model to serve different English dialects, which simplifies\\nthe process of training multi-dialect systems without the need for separate AM,\\nPM and LMs for each dialect. We show that simply pooling the data from all\\ndialects into one LAS model falls behind the performance of a model fine-tuned\\non each dialect. We then look at incorporating dialect-specific information\\ninto the model, both by modifying the training targets by inserting the dialect\\nsymbol at the end of the original grapheme sequence and also feeding a 1-hot\\nrepresentation of the dialect information into all layers of the model.\\nExperimental results on seven English dialects show that our proposed system is\\neffective in modeling dialect variations within a single LAS model,\\noutperforming a LAS model trained individually on each of the seven dialects by\\n3.1 ~ 16.5% relative.\\n', '  Accurate real time crime prediction is a fundamental issue for public safety,\\nbut remains a challenging problem for the scientific community. Crime\\noccurrences depend on many complex factors. Compared to many predictable\\nevents, crime is sparse. At different spatio-temporal scales, crime\\ndistributions display dramatically different patterns. These distributions are\\nof very low regularity in both space and time. In this work, we adapt the\\nstate-of-the-art deep learning spatio-temporal predictor, ST-ResNet [Zhang et\\nal, AAAI, 2017], to collectively predict crime distribution over the Los\\nAngeles area. Our models are two staged. First, we preprocess the raw crime\\ndata. This includes regularization in both space and time to enhance\\npredictable signals. Second, we adapt hierarchical structures of residual\\nconvolutional units to train multi-factor crime prediction models. Experiments\\nover a half year period in Los Angeles reveal highly accurate predictive power\\nof our models.\\n', '  Creating and modeling real-world graphs is a crucial problem in various\\napplications of engineering, biology, and social sciences; however, learning\\nthe distributions of nodes/edges and sampling from them to generate realistic\\ngraphs is still challenging. Moreover, generating a diverse set of synthetic\\ngraphs that all imitate a real network is not addressed. In this paper, the\\nnovel problem of creating diverse synthetic graphs is solved. First, we devise\\nthe deep supervised subset selection (DeepS3) algorithm; Given a ground-truth\\nset of data points, DeepS3 selects a diverse subset of all items (i.e. data\\npoints) that best represent the items in the ground-truth set. Furthermore, we\\npropose the deep graph representation recurrent network (GRRN) as a novel\\ngenerative model that learns a probabilistic representation of a real weighted\\ngraph. Training the GRRN, we generate a large set of synthetic graphs that are\\nlikely to follow the same features and adjacency patterns as the original one.\\nIncorporating GRRN with DeepS3, we select a diverse subset of generated graphs\\nthat best represent the behaviors of the real graph (i.e. our ground-truth). We\\napply our model to the novel problem of power grid synthesis, where a synthetic\\npower network is created with the same physical/geometric properties as a real\\npower system without revealing the real locations of the substations (nodes)\\nand the lines (edges), since such data is confidential. Experiments on the\\nSynthetic Power Grid Data Set show accurate synthetic networks that follow\\nsimilar structural and spatial properties as the real power grid.\\n', '  Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents\\nactivated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice,\\nor both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can\\nsometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since\\nthe 1960s and have influenced user interface development in games since the\\nearly 1980s, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to\\nplentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and\\nimplementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to\\nenhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be\\nused to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or\\nattack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper\\npresents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to\\nthe contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally,\\nquality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method\\nbased on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed\\nand examined.\\n', '  Tissue characterization has long been an important component of Computer\\nAided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for automatic lesion detection and further\\nclinical planning. Motivated by the superior performance of deep learning\\nmethods on various computer vision problems, there has been increasing work\\napplying deep learning to medical image analysis. However, the development of a\\nrobust and reliable deep learning model for computer-aided diagnosis is still\\nhighly challenging due to the combination of the high heterogeneity in the\\nmedical images and the relative lack of training samples. Specifically,\\nannotation and labeling of the medical images is much more expensive and\\ntime-consuming than other applications and often involves manual labor from\\nmultiple domain experts. In this work, we propose a multi-stage, self-paced\\nlearning framework utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify\\nComputed Tomography (CT) image patches. The key contribution of this approach\\nis that we augment the size of training samples by refining the unlabeled\\ninstances with a self-paced learning CNN. By implementing the framework on high\\nperformance computing servers including the NVIDIA DGX1 machine, we obtained\\nthe experimental result, showing that the self-pace boosted network\\nconsistently outperformed the original network even with very scarce manual\\nlabels. The performance gain indicates that applications with limited training\\nsamples such as medical image analysis can benefit from using the proposed\\nframework.\\n', '  Generating versatile and appropriate synthetic speech requires control over\\nthe output expression separate from the spoken text. Important non-textual\\nspeech variation is seldom annotated, in which case output control must be\\nlearned in an unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we perform an in-depth study\\nof methods for unsupervised learning of control in statistical speech\\nsynthesis. For example, we show that popular unsupervised training heuristics\\ncan be interpreted as variational inference in certain autoencoder models. We\\nadditionally connect these models to VQ-VAEs, another, recently-proposed class\\nof deep variational autoencoders, which we show can be derived from a very\\nsimilar mathematical argument. The implications of these new probabilistic\\ninterpretations are discussed. We illustrate the utility of the various\\napproaches with an application to acoustic modelling for emotional speech\\nsynthesis, where the unsupervised methods for learning expression control\\n(without access to emotional labels) are found to give results that in many\\naspects match or surpass the previous best supervised approach.\\n', '  We present a co-segmentation technique for space-time co-located image\\ncollections. These prevalent collections capture various dynamic events,\\nusually by multiple photographers, and may contain multiple co-occurring\\nobjects which are not necessarily part of the intended foreground object,\\nresulting in ambiguities for traditional co-segmentation techniques. Thus, to\\ndisambiguate what the common foreground object is, we introduce a\\nweakly-supervised technique, where we assume only a small seed, given in the\\nform of a single segmented image. We take a distributed approach, where local\\nbelief models are propagated and reinforced with similar images. Our technique\\nprogressively expands the foreground and background belief models across the\\nentire collection. The technique exploits the power of the entire set of image\\nwithout building a global model, and thus successfully overcomes large\\nvariability in appearance of the common foreground object. We demonstrate that\\nour method outperforms previous co-segmentation techniques on challenging\\nspace-time co-located collections, including dense benchmark datasets which\\nwere adapted for our novel problem setting.\\n', '  For many years, i-vector based audio embedding techniques were the dominant\\napproach for speaker verification and speaker diarization applications.\\nHowever, mirroring the rise of deep learning in various domains, neural network\\nbased audio embeddings, also known as d-vectors, have consistently demonstrated\\nsuperior speaker verification performance. In this paper, we build on the\\nsuccess of d-vector based speaker verification systems to develop a new\\nd-vector based approach to speaker diarization. Specifically, we combine\\nLSTM-based d-vector audio embeddings with recent work in non-parametric\\nclustering to obtain a state-of-the-art speaker diarization system. Our system\\nis evaluated on three standard public datasets, suggesting that d-vector based\\ndiarization systems offer significant advantages over traditional i-vector\\nbased systems. We achieved a 12.0% diarization error rate on NIST SRE 2000\\nCALLHOME, while our model is trained with out-of-domain data from voice search\\nlogs.\\n', '  Amino acid sequence portrays most intrinsic form of a protein and expresses\\nprimary structure of protein. The order of amino acids in a sequence enables a\\nprotein to acquire a particular stable conformation that is responsible for the\\nfunctions of the protein. This relationship between a sequence and its function\\nmotivates the need to analyse the sequences for predicting protein functions.\\nEarly generation computational methods using BLAST, FASTA, etc. perform\\nfunction transfer based on sequence similarity with existing databases and are\\ncomputationally slow. Although machine learning based approaches are fast, they\\nfail to perform well for long protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences with\\nmore than 300 amino acid residues). In this paper, we introduce a novel method\\nfor construction of two separate feature sets for protein sequences based on\\nanalysis of 1) single fixed-sized segments and 2) multi-sized segments, using\\nbi-directional long short-term memory network. Further, model based on proposed\\nfeature set is combined with the state of the art Multi-lable Linear\\nDiscriminant Analysis (MLDA) features based model to improve the accuracy.\\nExtensive evaluations using separate datasets for biological processes and\\nmolecular functions demonstrate promising results for both single-sized and\\nmulti-sized segments based feature sets. While former showed an improvement of\\n+3.37% and +5.48%, the latter produces an improvement of +5.38% and +8.00%\\nrespectively for two datasets over the state of the art MLDA based classifier.\\nAfter combining two models, there is a significant improvement of +7.41% and\\n+9.21% respectively for two datasets compared to MLDA based classifier.\\nSpecifically, the proposed approach performed well for the long protein\\nsequences and superior overall performance.\\n', \"  Lesion segmentation is the first step in most automatic melanoma recognition\\nsystems. Deficiencies and difficulties in dermoscopic images such as color\\ninconstancy, hair occlusion, dark corners and color charts make lesion\\nsegmentation an intricate task. In order to detect the lesion in the presence\\nof these problems, we propose a supervised saliency detection method tailored\\nfor dermoscopic images based on the discriminative regional feature integration\\n(DRFI). DRFI method incorporates multi-level segmentation, regional contrast,\\nproperty, background descriptors, and a random forest regressor to create\\nsaliency scores for each region in the image. In our improved saliency\\ndetection method, mDRFI, we have added some new features to regional property\\ndescriptors. Also, in order to achieve more robust regional background\\ndescriptors, a thresholding algorithm is proposed to obtain a new\\npseudo-background region. Findings reveal that mDRFI is superior to DRFI in\\ndetecting the lesion as the salient object in dermoscopic images. The proposed\\noverall lesion segmentation framework uses detected saliency map to construct\\nan initial mask of the lesion through thresholding and post-processing\\noperations. The initial mask is then evolving in a level set framework to fit\\nbetter on the lesion's boundaries. The results of evaluation tests on three\\npublic datasets show that our proposed segmentation method outperforms the\\nother conventional state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms and its performance\\nis comparable with most recent approaches that are based on deep convolutional\\nneural networks.\\n\", '  In recent years, supervised learning using Convolutional Neural Networks\\n(CNNs) has achieved great success in image classification tasks, and large\\nscale labeled datasets have contributed significantly to this achievement.\\nHowever, the definition of a label is often application dependent. For example,\\nan image of a cat can be labeled as \"cat\" or perhaps more specifically \"Persian\\ncat.\" We refer to this as label granularity. In this paper, we conduct\\nextensive experiments using various datasets to demonstrate and analyze how and\\nwhy training based on fine-grain labeling, such as \"Persian cat\" can improve\\nCNN accuracy on classifying coarse-grain classes, in this case \"cat.\" The\\nexperimental results show that training CNNs with fine-grain labels improves\\nboth network\\'s optimization and generalization capabilities, as intuitively it\\nencourages the network to learn more features, and hence increases\\nclassification accuracy on coarse-grain classes under all datasets considered.\\nMoreover, fine-grain labels enhance data efficiency in CNN training. For\\nexample, a CNN trained with fine-grain labels and only 40% of the total\\ntraining data can achieve higher accuracy than a CNN trained with the full\\ntraining dataset and coarse-grain labels. These results point to two possible\\napplications of this work: (i) with sufficient human resources, one can improve\\nCNN performance by re-labeling the dataset with fine-grain labels, and (ii)\\nwith limited human resources, to improve CNN performance, rather than\\ncollecting more training data, one may instead use fine-grain labels for the\\ndataset. We further propose a metric called Average Confusion Ratio to\\ncharacterize the effectiveness of fine-grain labeling, and show its use through\\nextensive experimentation.

(b) We create a guided by\\n2D landmarks network which converts 2D landmark annotations to 3D and unifies\\nall existing datasets, leading to the creation of LS3D-W, the largest and most\\nchallenging 3D facial landmark dataset to date ~230,000 images. (c) Following\\nthat, we train a neural network for 3D face alignment and evaluate it on the\\nnewly introduced LS3D-W. (d) We further look into the effect of all\\n\"traditional\" factors affecting face alignment performance like large pose,\\ninitialization and resolution, and introduce a \"new\" one, namely the size of\\nthe network. (e) We show that both 2D and 3D face alignment networks achieve\\nperformance of remarkable accuracy which is probably close to saturating the\\ndatasets used.

We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we\\njointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences,\\nand a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to\\ndistinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated\\nones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the\\ngenerative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble\\nhuman dialogues.\\nIn addition to adversarial training we describe a model for adversarial {\\\\em\\nevaluation} that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation\\nmetric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls. Experimental results on\\nseveral metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate that the\\nadversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses than previous\\nbaselines.\\n', '  For decades, context-dependent phonemes have been the dominant sub-word unit\\nfor conventional acoustic modeling systems. This status quo has begun to be\\nchallenged recently by end-to-end models which seek to combine acoustic,\\npronunciation, and language model components into a single neural network. Such\\nsystems, which typically predict graphemes or words, simplify the recognition\\nprocess since they remove the need for a separate expert-curated pronunciation\\nlexicon to map from phoneme-based units to words. However, there has been\\nlittle previous work comparing phoneme-based versus grapheme-based sub-word\\nunits in the end-to-end modeling framework, to determine whether the gains from\\nsuch approaches are primarily due to the new probabilistic model, or from the\\njoint learning of the various components with grapheme-based units.\\nIn this work, we conduct detailed experiments which are aimed at quantifying\\nthe value of phoneme-based pronunciation lexica in the context of end-to-end\\nmodels. We examine phoneme-based end-to-end models, which are contrasted\\nagainst grapheme-based ones on a large vocabulary English Voice-search task,\\nwhere we find that graphemes do indeed outperform phonemes. We also compare\\ngrapheme and phoneme-based approaches on a multi-dialect English task, which\\nonce again confirm the superiority of graphemes, greatly simplifying the system\\nfor recognizing multiple dialects.\\n', '  Music creation is typically composed of two parts: composing the musical\\nscore, and then performing the score with instruments to make sounds. While\\nrecent work has made much progress in automatic music generation in the\\nsymbolic domain, few attempts have been made to build an AI model that can\\nrender realistic music audio from musical scores. Directly synthesizing audio\\nwith sound sample libraries often leads to mechanical and deadpan results,\\nsince musical scores do not contain performance-level information, such as\\nsubtle changes in timing and dynamics. Moreover, while the task may sound like\\na text-to-speech synthesis problem, there are fundamental differences since\\nmusic audio has rich polyphonic sounds. To build such an AI performer, we\\npropose in this paper a deep convolutional model that learns in an end-to-end\\nmanner the score-to-audio mapping between a symbolic representation of music\\ncalled the piano rolls and an audio representation of music called the\\nspectrograms. The model consists of two subnets: the ContourNet, which uses a\\nU-Net structure to learn the correspondence between piano rolls and\\nspectrograms and to give an initial result; and the TextureNet, which further\\nuses a multi-band residual network to refine the result by adding the spectral\\ntexture of overtones and timbre.

The key insight of our interactive code search technique ALICE is\\nthat user feedback could be actively incorporated to allow users to easily\\nexpress and refine search queries. We design a query language to model the\\nstructure and semantics of code as logic facts. Given a code example with user\\nannotations, ALICE automatically extracts a logic query from features that are\\ntagged as important. Users can refine the search query by labeling one or more\\nexamples as desired (positive) or irrelevant (negative). ALICE then infers a\\nnew logic query that separates the positives from negative examples via active\\ninductive logic programming. Our comprehensive and systematic simulation\\nexperiment shows that ALICE removes a large number of false positives quickly\\nby actively incorporating user feedback. Its search algorithm is also robust to\\nnoise and user labeling mistakes. Our choice of leveraging both positive and\\nnegative examples and the nested containment structure of selected code is\\neffective in refining search queries.

Much research has been done to find good\\nfeature representations that extract the useful information to correctly\\nclassify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features\\nhave been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a\\nfeature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of\\ndimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that\\nmany features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are\\nless informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature\\nrepresentation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an\\nauto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the\\ntraining batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature\\nrepresentations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to\\nperform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the\\nproposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)\\nnight recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing.

Meanwhile, network embedding has emerged as a\\npowerful method for learning network representation, where the learned\\nembedding can be used as features in various downstream applications.\\nTherefore, we are motivated to propose a novel embedding learning\\nframework---AspEm---to preserve the semantic information in HINs based on\\nmultiple aspects. Instead of preserving information of the network in one\\nsemantic space, AspEm encapsulates information regarding each aspect\\nindividually. In order to select aspects for embedding purpose, we further\\ndevise a solution for AspEm based on dataset-wide statistics. To corroborate\\nthe efficacy of AspEm, we conducted experiments on two real-words datasets with\\ntwo types of applications---classification and link prediction.

The autoencoder is trained\\nwith eight-measure segments from a corpus of 10,000 MIDI files, each of which\\nhas had its melody track and chord progressions identified heuristically. The\\nautoencoder maps melody into a multi-dimensional feature space, conditioned by\\nthe underlying chord progression. A melody is then generated by feeding a\\nrandom sample from that space to the autoencoder's decoder, along with the\\nchord progression generated by the grammar. The autoencoder can make musically\\nplausible variations on an existing melody, suitable for recurring motifs. It\\ncan also reharmonize a melody to a new chord progression, keeping the rhythm\\nand contour. The generated music compares favorably with that generated by\\nother academic and commercial software designed for the music-as-a-service\\nindustry.\\n\", \"  Learning with auxiliary tasks has been shown to improve the generalisation of\\na primary task. However, this comes at the cost of manually-labelling\\nadditional tasks which may, or may not, be useful for the primary task. We\\npropose a new method which automatically learns labels for an auxiliary task,\\nsuch that any supervised learning task can be improved without requiring access\\nto additional data. The approach is to train two neural networks: a\\nlabel-generation network to predict the auxiliary labels, and a multi-task\\nnetwork to train the primary task alongside the auxiliary task. The loss for\\nthe label-generation network incorporates the multi-task network's performance,\\nand so this interaction between the two networks can be seen as a form of meta\\nlearning. We show that our proposed method, Meta AuXiliary Learning (MAXL),\\noutperforms single-task learning on 7 image datasets by a significant margin,\\nwithout requiring additional auxiliary labels. We also show that MAXL\\noutperforms several other baselines for generating auxiliary labels, and is\\neven competitive when compared with human-defined auxiliary labels.

Traditional multi-label learning algorithms treat each\\nclass label as a logical indicator of whether the corresponding label is\\nrelevant or irrelevant to the instance, i.e., +1 represents relevant to the\\ninstance and -1 represents irrelevant to the instance. Such label represented\\nby -1 or +1 is called logical label. Logical label cannot reflect different\\nlabel importance. However, for real-world multi-label learning problems, the\\nimportance of each possible label is generally different. For the real\\napplications, it is difficult to obtain the label importance information\\ndirectly. Thus we need a method to reconstruct the essential label importance\\nfrom the logical multilabel data. To solve this problem, we assume that each\\nmulti-label instance is described by a vector of latent real-valued labels,\\nwhich can reflect the importance of the corresponding labels. Such label is\\ncalled numerical label. The process of reconstructing the numerical labels from\\nthe logical multi-label data via utilizing the logical label information and\\nthe topological structure in the feature space is called Label Enhancement.

However, a major\\nconsequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for\\nthe patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug\\ninteractions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another\\ndrug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex\\nrelationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small\\nclinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an\\nimportant challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here,\\nwe present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The\\napproach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions,\\ndrug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are\\nrepresented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a\\ndifferent type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal\\ngraphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph\\nconvolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal\\nnetworks.

Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy\\nside effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it\\nautomatically learns representations of side effects indicative of\\nco-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models\\nparticularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on\\npredominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because\\nof effective sharing of model parameters across edge types.

With a combination of simple preprocessing\\nsteps, we reach state of the art performance in gender recognition.\\n\", '  Most video summarization approaches have focused on extracting a summary from\\na single video; we propose an unsupervised framework for summarizing a\\ncollection of videos. We observe that each video in the collection may contain\\nsome information that other videos do not have, and thus exploring the\\nunderlying complementarity could be beneficial in creating a diverse\\ninformative summary. We develop a novel diversity-aware sparse optimization\\nmethod for multi-video summarization by exploring the complementarity within\\nthe videos. Our approach extracts a multi-video summary which is both\\ninteresting and representative in describing the whole video collection. To\\nefficiently solve our optimization problem, we develop an alternating\\nminimization algorithm that minimizes the overall objective function with\\nrespect to one video at a time while fixing the other videos. Moreover, we\\nintroduce a new benchmark dataset, Tour20, that contains 140 videos with\\nmultiple human created summaries, which were acquired in a controlled\\nexperiment. Finally, by extensive experiments on the new Tour20 dataset and\\nseveral other multi-view datasets, we show that the proposed approach clearly\\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the two problems-topic-oriented\\nvideo summarization and multi-view video summarization in a camera network.\\n', '  The need for large annotated image datasets for training Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs) has been a significant impediment for their adoption in\\ncomputer vision applications. We show that with transfer learning an effective\\nobject detector can be trained almost entirely on synthetically rendered\\ndatasets. We apply this strategy for detecting pack- aged food products\\nclustered in refrigerator scenes. Our CNN trained only with 4000 synthetic\\nimages achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24 on a test set with 55\\ndistinct products as objects of interest and 17 distractor objects. A further\\nincrease of 12% in the mAP is obtained by adding only 400 real images to these\\n4000 synthetic images in the training set. A high degree of photorealism in the\\nsynthetic images was not essential in achieving this performance. We analyze\\nfactors like training data set size and 3D model dictionary size for their\\ninfluence on detection performance. Additionally, training strategies like\\nfine-tuning with selected layers and early stopping which affect transfer\\nlearning from synthetic scenes to real scenes are explored. Training CNNs with\\nsynthetic datasets is a novel application of high-performance computing and a\\npromising approach for object detection applications in domains where there is\\na dearth of large annotated image data.\\n', '  Crowdsourced video systems like YouTube and Twitch.tv have been a major\\ninternet phenomenon and are nowadays entertaining over a billion users. In\\naddition to video sharing and viewing, over the years they have developed new\\nfeatures to boost the community engagement and some managed to attract users to\\ndonate, to the community as well as to other users. User donation directly\\nreflects and influences user engagement in the community, and has a great\\nimpact on the success of such systems. Nevertheless, user donations in\\ncrowdsourced video systems remain trade secrets for most companies and to date\\nare still unexplored. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap, and we obtain\\nand provide a publicly available dataset on user donations in one crowdsourced\\nvideo system named BiliBili. Based on information on nearly 40 thousand\\ndonators, we examine the dynamics of user donations and their social\\nrelationships, we quantitively reveal the factors that potentially impact user\\ndonation, and we adopt machine-learned classifiers and network representation\\nlearning models to timely and accurately predict the destinations of the\\nmajority and the individual donations.\\n', '  A robot that can carry out a natural-language instruction has been a dream\\nsince before the Jetsons cartoon series imagined a life of leisure mediated by\\na fleet of attentive robot helpers. It is a dream that remains stubbornly\\ndistant. However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made\\nincredible progress in closely related areas. This is significant because a\\nrobot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of\\nwhat it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to\\nVisual Question Answering. Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded\\nsequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are\\napplicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language\\nmethods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation\\ninstructions, we present the Matterport3D Simulator -- a large-scale\\nreinforcement learning environment based on real imagery. Using this simulator,\\nwhich can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we\\nprovide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language\\nnavigation in real buildings -- the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset.\\n', '  The discriminative power of modern deep learning models for 3D human action\\nrecognition is growing ever so potent. In conjunction with the recent\\nresurgence of 3D human action representation with 3D skeletons, the quality and\\nthe pace of recent progress have been significant. However, the inner workings\\nof state-of-the-art learning based methods in 3D human action recognition still\\nremain mostly black-box. In this work, we propose to use a new class of models\\nknown as Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCN) for 3D human action\\nrecognition. Compared to popular LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network models,\\ngiven interpretable input such as 3D skeletons, TCN provides us a way to\\nexplicitly learn readily interpretable spatio-temporal representations for 3D\\nhuman action recognition. We provide our strategy in re-designing the TCN with\\ninterpretability in mind and how such characteristics of the model is leveraged\\nto construct a powerful 3D activity recognition method. Through this work, we\\nwish to take a step towards a spatio-temporal model that is easier to\\nunderstand, explain and interpret. The resulting model, Res-TCN, achieves\\nstate-of-the-art results on the largest 3D human action recognition dataset,\\nNTU-RGBD.\\n', '  Objective.

Information science, as represented by Online Information Review\\nin the present study, is an evolving discipline that draws on literature from a\\nrelatively wide range of subjects.

Related proteins\\nusually bind to similar ligands. Chemical characteristics of ligands are known\\nto capture the functional and mechanistic properties of proteins suggesting\\nthat a ligand based approach can be utilized in protein representation. In this\\nstudy, we propose SMILESVec, a SMILES-based method to represent ligands and a\\nnovel method to compute similarity of proteins by describing them based on\\ntheir ligands. The proteins are defined utilizing the word-embeddings of the\\nSMILES strings of their ligands. The performance of the proposed protein\\ndescription method is evaluated in protein clustering task using TransClust and\\nMCL algorithms. Two other protein representation methods that utilize protein\\nsequence, BLAST and ProtVec, and two compound fingerprint based protein\\nrepresentation methods are compared. We showed that ligand-based protein\\nrepresentation, which uses only SMILES strings of the ligands that proteins\\nbind to, performs as well as protein-sequence based representation methods in\\nprotein clustering. The results suggest that ligand-based protein description\\ncan be an alternative to the traditional sequence or structure based\\nrepresentation of proteins and this novel approach can be applied to different\\nbioinformatics problems such as prediction of new protein-ligand interactions\\nand protein function annotation.\\n', '  Programmable packet processors and P4 as a programming language for such\\ndevices have gained significant interest, because their flexibility enables\\nrapid development of a diverse set of applications that work at line rate.\\nHowever, this flexibility, combined with the complexity of devices and\\nnetworks, increases the chance of introducing subtle bugs that are hard to\\ndiscover manually. Worse, this is a domain where bugs can have catastrophic\\nconsequences, yet formal analysis tools for P4 programs / networks are missing.\\nWe argue that formal analysis tools must be based on a formal semantics of\\nthe target language, rather than on its informal specification. To this end, we\\nprovide an executable formal semantics of the P4 language in the K framework.\\nBased on this semantics, K provides an interpreter and various analysis tools\\nincluding a symbolic model checker and a deductive program verifier for P4.\\nThis paper overviews our formal K semantics of P4, as well as several P4\\nlanguage design issues that we found during our formalization process. We also\\ndiscuss some applications resulting from the tools provided by K for P4\\nprogrammers and network administrators as well as language designers and\\ncompiler developers, such as detection of unportable code, state space\\nexploration of P4 programs and of networks, bug finding using symbolic\\nexecution, data plane verification, program verification, and translation\\nvalidation.\\n', '  Domain shift refers to the well known problem that a model trained in one\\nsource domain performs poorly when applied to a target domain with different\\nstatistics. {Domain Generalization} (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this\\nissue by producing models which by design generalize well to novel testing\\ndomains. We propose a novel {meta-learning} method for domain generalization.\\nRather than designing a specific model that is robust to domain shift as in\\nmost previous DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure for DG.\\nOur algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing\\nvirtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective\\nrequires that steps to improve training domain performance should also improve\\ntesting domain performance. This meta-learning procedure trains models with\\ngood generalization ability to novel domains. We evaluate our method and\\nachieve state of the art results on a recent cross-domain image classification\\nbenchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic reinforcement\\nlearning tasks.\\n', '  We propose MAD-GAN, an intuitive generalization to the Generative Adversarial\\nNetworks (GANs) and its conditional variants to address the well known problem\\nof mode collapse. First, MAD-GAN is a multi-agent GAN architecture\\nincorporating multiple generators and one discriminator. Second, to enforce\\nthat different generators capture diverse high probability modes, the\\ndiscriminator of MAD-GAN is designed such that along with finding the real and\\nfake samples, it is also required to identify the generator that generated the\\ngiven fake sample. Intuitively, to succeed in this task, the discriminator must\\nlearn to push different generators towards different identifiable modes. We\\nperform extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets and compare\\nMAD-GAN with different variants of GAN. We show high quality diverse sample\\ngenerations for challenging tasks such as image-to-image translation and face\\ngeneration. In addition, we also show that MAD-GAN is able to disentangle\\ndifferent modalities when trained using highly challenging diverse-class\\ndataset (e.g. dataset with images of forests, icebergs, and bedrooms). In the\\nend, we show its efficacy on the unsupervised feature representation task. In\\nAppendix, we introduce a similarity based competing objective (MAD-GAN-Sim)\\nwhich encourages different generators to generate diverse samples based on a\\nuser defined similarity metric. We show its performance on the image-to-image\\ntranslation, and also show its effectiveness on the unsupervised feature\\nrepresentation task.\\n', '  Forward-looking sonar can capture high resolution images of underwater\\nscenes, but their interpretation is complex. Generic object detection in such\\nimages has not been solved, specially in cases of small and unknown objects. In\\ncomparison, detection proposal algorithms have produced top performing object\\ndetectors in real-world color images. In this work we develop a Convolutional\\nNeural Network that can reliably score objectness of image windows in\\nforward-looking sonar images and by thresholding objectness, we generate\\ndetection proposals. In our dataset of marine garbage objects, we obtain 94%\\nrecall, generating around 60 proposals per image. The biggest strength of our\\nmethod is that it can generalize to previously unseen objects. We show this by\\ndetecting chain links, walls and a wrench without previous training in such\\nobjects. We strongly believe our method can be used for class-independent\\nobject detection, with many real-world applications such as chain following and\\nmine detection.\\n', '  We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object\\ninstance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image\\nwhile simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each\\ninstance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a\\nbranch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for\\nbounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small\\noverhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to\\ngeneralize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the\\nsame framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of\\nchallenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and\\nperson keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms\\nall existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016\\nchallenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a\\nsolid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.\\nCode has been made available at: this https URL\\n', '  Embedded, continual learning for autonomous and adaptive behavior is a key\\napplication of neuromorphic hardware. However, neuromorphic implementations of\\nembedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and efficient have\\nbeen hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. As a result, the\\nmost neuromorphic hardware is trained off-line on large clusters of dedicated\\nprocessors or GPUs and transferred post hoc to the device. We address this by\\nintroducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (NSAT), a neuromorphic\\ncomputational framework facilitating flexible and efficient embedded learning\\nby matching algorithmic requirements and neural and synaptic dynamics. NSAT\\nsupports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning\\nalgorithms including deep learning.

We anticipate that this contribution will\\nestablish the foundation for a new generation of devices enabling adaptive\\nmobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with data-driven autonomy.\\n', \"  Paraphrase generation is an important problem in NLP, especially in question\\nanswering, information retrieval, information extraction, conversation systems,\\nto name a few. In this paper, we address the problem of generating paraphrases\\nautomatically. Our proposed method is based on a combination of deep generative\\nmodels (VAE) with sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM) to generate paraphrases,\\ngiven an input sentence. Traditional VAEs when combined with recurrent neural\\nnetworks can generate free text but they are not suitable for paraphrase\\ngeneration for a given sentence. We address this problem by conditioning the\\nboth, encoder and decoder sides of VAE, on the original sentence, so that it\\ncan generate the given sentence's paraphrases. Unlike most existing models, our\\nmodel is simple, modular and can generate multiple paraphrases, for a given\\nsentence. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed method on a benchmark\\nparaphrase dataset demonstrates its efficacy, and its performance improvement\\nover the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, whereas qualitative\\nhuman evaluation indicate that the generated paraphrases are well-formed,\\ngrammatically correct, and are relevant to the input sentence. Furthermore, we\\nevaluate our method on a newly released question paraphrase dataset, and\\nestablish a new baseline for future research.\\n\", '  We propose an Encoder-Classifier framework to model the Mandarin tones using\\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN). In this framework, extracted frames of\\nfeatures for tone classification are fed in to the RNN and casted into a fixed\\ndimensional vector (tone embedding) and then classified into tone types using a\\nsoftmax layer along with other auxiliary inputs. We investigate various\\nconfigurations that help to improve the model, including pooling, feature\\nsplicing and utilization of syllable-level tone embeddings. Besides, tone\\nembeddings and durations of the contextual syllables are exploited to\\nfacilitate tone classification. Experimental results on Mandarin tone\\nclassification show the proposed network setups improve tone classification\\naccuracy. The results indicate that the RNN encoder-classifier based tone model\\nflexibly accommodates heterogeneous inputs (sequential and segmental) and hence\\nhas the advantages from both the sequential classification tone models and\\nsegmental classification tone models.\\n', '  The ability to generate natural language sequences from source code snippets\\nhas a variety of applications such as code summarization, documentation, and\\nretrieval. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, adopted from neural machine\\ntranslation (NMT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on these tasks by\\ntreating source code as a sequence of tokens. We present ${\\\\rm {\\\\scriptsize\\nCODE2SEQ}}$: an alternative approach that leverages the syntactic structure of\\nprogramming languages to better encode source code. Our model represents a code\\nsnippet as the set of compositional paths in its abstract syntax tree (AST) and\\nuses attention to select the relevant paths while decoding. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our approach for two tasks, two programming languages, and\\nfour datasets of up to $16$M examples. Our model significantly outperforms\\nprevious models that were specifically designed for programming languages, as\\nwell as state-of-the-art NMT models.

In response, various methods\\nhave recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex\\nmodels, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one\\nmethod is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a\\nunified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive\\nexPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular\\nprediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class\\nof additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing\\nthere is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties.\\nThe new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent\\nmethods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights\\nfrom this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational\\nperformance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous\\napproaches.\\n\", '  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models usually use large target vocabulary\\nsizes to capture most of the words in the target language. The vocabulary size\\nis a big factor when decoding new sentences as the final softmax layer\\nnormalizes over all possible target words. To address this problem, it is\\nwidely common to restrict the target vocabulary with candidate lists based on\\nthe source sentence. Usually, the candidate lists are a combination of external\\nword-to-word aligner, phrase table entries or most frequent words. In this\\nwork, we propose a simple and yet novel approach to learn candidate lists\\ndirectly from the attention layer during NMT training. The candidate lists are\\nhighly optimized for the current NMT model and do not need any external\\ncomputation of the candidate pool. We show significant decoding speedup\\ncompared with using the entire vocabulary, without losing any translation\\nquality for two language pairs.\\n', '  Segmenting foreground object from a video is a challenging task because of\\nthe large deformations of the objects, occlusions, and background clutter. In\\nthis paper, we propose a frame-by-frame but computationally efficient approach\\nfor video object segmentation by clustering visually similar generic object\\nsegments throughout the video. Our algorithm segments various object instances\\nappearing in the video and then perform clustering in order to group visually\\nsimilar segments into one cluster. Since the object that needs to be segmented\\nappears in most part of the video, we can retrieve the foreground segments from\\nthe cluster having maximum number of segments, thus filtering out noisy\\nsegments that do not represent any object. We then apply a track and fill\\napproach in order to localize the objects in the frames where the object\\nsegmentation framework fails to segment any object. Our algorithm performs\\ncomparably to the recent automatic methods for video object segmentation when\\nbenchmarked on DAVIS dataset while being computationally much faster.\\n', '  Being an unsupervised machine learning and data mining technique,\\nbiclustering and its multimodal extensions are becoming popular tools for\\nanalysing object-attribute data in different domains. Apart from conventional\\nclustering techniques, biclustering is searching for homogeneous groups of\\nobjects while keeping their common description, e.g., in binary setting, their\\nshared attributes. In bioinformatics, biclustering is used to find genes, which\\nare active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers.\\nHowever, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene\\nexpression analysis, may overlook the existing methods. For instance, BiMax\\nalgorithm is aimed at finding biclusters, which are well-known for decades as\\nformal concepts. Moreover, even if bioinformatics classify the biclustering\\nmethods according to reasonable domain-driven criteria, their classification\\ntaxonomies may be different from survey to survey and not full as well.

The potential behavioural consequences of these\\ndifferences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing\\nhuman and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the\\nhuman visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast\\nreduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find\\nprogressively diverging classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs\\nwhen the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked\\ndifferences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object\\nrecognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured\\nand freely available behavioural datasets provide a new useful benchmark for\\nthe computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a\\nmotivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could\\nfacilitate this robustness.\\n', '  It is well-established by cognitive neuroscience that human perception of\\nobjects constitutes a complex process, where object appearance information is\\ncombined with evidence about the so-called object \"affordances\", namely the\\ntypes of actions that humans typically perform when interacting with them. This\\nfact has recently motivated the \"sensorimotor\" approach to the challenging task\\nof automatic object recognition, where both information sources are fused to\\nimprove robustness. In this work, the aforementioned paradigm is adopted,\\nsurpassing current limitations of sensorimotor object recognition research.\\nSpecifically, the deep learning paradigm is introduced to the problem for the\\nfirst time, developing a number of novel neuro-biologically and\\nneuro-physiologically inspired architectures that utilize state-of-the-art\\nneural networks for fusing the available information sources in multiple ways.\\nThe proposed methods are evaluated using a large RGB-D corpus, which is\\nspecifically collected for the task of sensorimotor object recognition and is\\nmade publicly available. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of\\naffordance information to object recognition, achieving an up to 29% relative\\nerror reduction by its inclusion.\\n', \"  We address personalization issues of image captioning, which have not been\\ndiscussed yet in previous research. For a query image, we aim to generate a\\ndescriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's active\\nvocabularies in previous documents. As applications of personalized image\\ncaptioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post\\ngeneration, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1.1M posts\\nfrom 6.3K users. We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence\\nMemory Network (CSMN). Its unique updates over previous memory network models\\ninclude (i) exploiting memory as a repository for multiple types of context\\ninformation, (ii) appending previously generated words into memory to capture\\nlong-term information without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem,\\nand (iii) adopting CNN memory structure to jointly represent nearby ordered\\nmemory slots for better context understanding. With quantitative evaluation and\\nuser studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show the effectiveness of the three\\nnovel features of CSMN and its performance enhancement for personalized image\\ncaptioning over state-of-the-art captioning models.\\n\", '  Profound vitamin B12 deficiency is a known cause of disease, but the role of\\nlow or intermediate levels of B12 in the development of neuropathy and other\\nneuropsychiatric symptoms as well as the relationship of eating meat and B12\\nlevels is unclear. Here we use food-related internet search patterns from a\\nsample of 8.5 million US-based people as a proxy to B12 intake and correlate\\nthese searches with internet searches related to possible effects of B12\\ndeficiency. Food-related search patterns are highly correlated with known\\nconsumption and food-related searches (Spearman 0.69). Awareness of B12\\ndeficiency was associated with a higher consumption of B12-rich foods and with\\nqueries for B12 supplements. Searches for terms related to neurological\\ndisorders were correlated with searches for B12-poor foods, in contrast with\\ncontrol terms. Popular medicines, those having fewer indications, and those\\nwhich are predominantly used to treat pain are more strongly correlated with\\nthe ability to predict neuropathic pain queries using the B12 contents of food.\\nOur findings provide evidence for the utility of using Internet search patterns\\nto investigate health questions in large populations and suggest that low B12\\nintake may be associated with a broader spectrum of neurological disorders than\\ncurrently appreciated.\\n', '  In deep reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, an efficient exploration mechanism\\nshould be able to encourage an agent to take actions that lead to less frequent\\nstates which may yield higher accumulative future return. However, both knowing\\nabout the future and evaluating the frequentness of states are non-trivial\\ntasks, especially for deep RL domains, where a state is represented by\\nhigh-dimensional image frames. In this paper, we propose a novel informed\\nexploration framework for deep RL, where we build the capability for an RL\\nagent to predict over the future transitions and evaluate the frequentness for\\nthe predicted future frames in a meaningful manner. To this end, we train a\\ndeep prediction model to predict future frames given a state-action pair, and a\\nconvolutional autoencoder model to hash over the seen frames. In addition, to\\nutilize the counts derived from the seen frames to evaluate the frequentness\\nfor the predicted frames, we tackle the challenge of matching the predicted\\nfuture frames and their corresponding seen frames at the latent feature level.\\nIn this way, we derive a reliable metric for evaluating the novelty of the\\nfuture direction pointed by each action, and hence inform the agent to explore\\nthe least frequent one.\\n', \"  The impact of developmental and aging processes on brain connectivity and the\\nconnectome has been widely studied. Network theoretical measures and certain\\ntopological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a\\nneed to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute\\ntowards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational\\nprinciple is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are\\nstrongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is\\ncritical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily\\nfocus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic\\nanalysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from\\nthis backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied\\nto structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available\\nlifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age\\nalongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.\\nOur results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in\\ntransitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in\\nthe feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and\\nsegregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different\\ndevelopmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to\\nits rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal\\nthe evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.\\n\", '  Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success\\nin various tasks, they still face challenges in generating high quality images.\\nIn this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN)\\naiming at generating high-resolution photo-realistic images. First, we propose\\na two-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v1, for\\ntext-to-image synthesis. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and\\ncolors of the object based on given text description, yielding low-resolution\\nimages. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs,\\nand generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Second, an\\nadvanced multi-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v2,\\nis proposed for both conditional and unconditional generative tasks. Our\\nStackGAN-v2 consists of multiple generators and discriminators in a tree-like\\nstructure; images at multiple scales corresponding to the same scene are\\ngenerated from different branches of the tree. StackGAN-v2 shows more stable\\ntraining behavior than StackGAN-v1 by jointly approximating multiple\\ndistributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed stacked\\ngenerative adversarial networks significantly outperform other state-of-the-art\\nmethods in generating photo-realistic images.\\n', '  Deep neural networks require a large amount of labeled training data during\\nsupervised learning. However, collecting and labeling so much data might be\\ninfeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a source-target selective\\njoint fine-tuning scheme for improving the performance of deep learning tasks\\nwith insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with\\ninsufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source\\nlearning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task\\ndoes not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a\\nsubset of training images from the original source learning task whose\\nlow-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task,\\nand jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically,\\nwe compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on\\ntraining images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a\\ndesired subset of training samples for the source learning task.\\nExperiments demonstrate that our selective joint fine-tuning scheme achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple visual classification tasks with\\ninsufficient training data for deep learning. Such tasks include Caltech 256,\\nMIT Indoor 67, Oxford Flowers 102 and Stanford Dogs 120. In comparison to\\nfine-tuning without a source domain, the proposed method can improve the\\nclassification accuracy by 2% - 10% using a single model.\\n', '  Due to recent advances in technology, the recording and analysis of video\\ndata has become an increasingly common component of athlete training\\nprogrammes. Today it is incredibly easy and affordable to set up a fixed camera\\nand record athletes in a wide range of sports, such as diving, gymnastics,\\ngolf, tennis, etc. However, the manual analysis of the obtained footage is a\\ntime-consuming task which involves isolating actions of interest and\\ncategorizing them using domain-specific knowledge. In order to automate this\\nkind of task, three challenging sub-problems are often encountered: 1)\\ntemporally cropping events/actions of interest from continuous video; 2)\\ntracking the object of interest; and 3) classifying the events/actions of\\ninterest.\\nMost previous work has focused on solving just one of the above sub-problems\\nin isolation. In contrast, this paper provides a complete solution to the\\noverall action monitoring task in the context of a challenging real-world\\nexemplar. Specifically, we address the problem of diving classification. This\\nis a challenging problem since the person (diver) of interest typically\\noccupies fewer than 1% of the pixels in each frame. The model is required to\\nlearn the temporal boundaries of a dive, even though other divers and\\nbystanders may be in view. Finally, the model must be sensitive to subtle\\nchanges in body pose over a large number of frames to determine the\\nclassification code. We provide effective solutions to each of the sub-problems\\nwhich combine to provide a highly functional solution to the task as a whole.\\nThe techniques proposed can be easily generalized to video footage recorded\\nfrom other sports.\\n', \"  Feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently\\nstate-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further,\\nthey are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of\\nneurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual\\nsystems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical\\nCNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from\\ndownstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in\\nimproving classification performance. We found that standard forms of\\nrecurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the\\nImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural\\nfeatures, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially.\\nWe extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of\\nmodel architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and\\nlong-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these\\ntask-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate\\nvisual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the\\nbrain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.\\n\", '  Remote sensing image scene classification plays an important role in a wide\\nrange of applications and hence has been receiving remarkable attention. During\\nthe past years, significant efforts have been made to develop various datasets\\nor present a variety of approaches for scene classification from remote sensing\\nimages. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning datasets and\\nmethods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all\\nexisting datasets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of\\nscene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and\\ndiversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the\\ndevelopment of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This\\npaper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we\\npropose a large-scale dataset, termed \"NWPU-RESISC45\", which is a publicly\\navailable benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC),\\ncreated by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This dataset contains\\n31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The\\nproposed NWPU-RESISC45 (i) is large-scale on the scene classes and the total\\nimage number, (ii) holds big variations in translation, spatial resolution,\\nviewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion, and (iii) has\\nhigh within-class diversity and between-class similarity. The creation of this\\ndataset will enable the community to develop and evaluate various data-driven\\nalgorithms. Finally, several representative methods are evaluated using the\\nproposed dataset and the results are reported as a useful baseline for future\\nresearch.\\n', '  This paper proposes a new algorithm for controlling classification results by\\ngenerating a small additive perturbation without changing the classifier\\nnetwork. Our work is inspired by existing works generating adversarial\\nperturbation that worsens classification performance. In contrast to the\\nexisting methods, our work aims to generate perturbations that can enhance\\noverall classification performance. To solve this performance enhancement\\nproblem, we newly propose a perturbation generation network (PGN) influenced by\\nthe adversarial learning strategy. In our problem, the information in a large\\nexternal dataset is summarized by a small additive perturbation, which helps to\\nimprove the performance of the classifier trained with the target dataset. In\\naddition to this performance enhancement problem, we show that the proposed PGN\\ncan be adopted to solve the classical adversarial problem without utilizing the\\ninformation on the target classifier. The mentioned characteristics of our\\nmethod are verified through extensive experiments on publicly available visual\\ndatasets.\\n', '  Computer aided diagnostic (CAD) system is crucial for modern med-ical\\nimaging. But almost all CAD systems operate on reconstructed images, which were\\noptimized for radiologists. Computer vision can capture features that is subtle\\nto human observers, so it is desirable to design a CAD system op-erating on the\\nraw data. In this paper, we proposed a deep-neural-network-based detection\\nsystem for lung nodule detection in computed tomography (CT). A\\nprimal-dual-type deep reconstruction network was applied first to convert the\\nraw data to the image space, followed by a 3-dimensional convolutional neural\\nnetwork (3D-CNN) for the nodule detection. For efficient network training, the\\ndeep reconstruction network and the CNN detector was trained sequentially\\nfirst, then followed by one epoch of end-to-end fine tuning. The method was\\nevaluated on the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI)\\nwith simulated forward projections. With 144 multi-slice fanbeam pro-jections,\\nthe proposed end-to-end detector could achieve comparable sensitivity with the\\nreference detector, which was trained and applied on the fully-sampled image\\ndata. It also demonstrated superior detection performance compared to detectors\\ntrained on the reconstructed images. The proposed method is general and could\\nbe expanded to most detection tasks in medical imaging.\\n', '  From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated\\nunder a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and\\narduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from\\nelectronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to\\npublic health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of\\ndigital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for\\nintegrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple\\nfacets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to\\nderive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to\\nexecute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on\\nwhich the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant\\neffort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data\\nobtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is\\nimportant to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In\\nfact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare\\ndata presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted\\nfor throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on\\nhighlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct\\ncomponents, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes\\nof the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations\\nduring model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model\\noutput. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates\\nto the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose\\non the efficiency of machine learning techniques.\\n', '  Recent advances in Representation Learning and Adversarial Training seem to\\nsucceed in removing unwanted features from the learned representation. We show\\nthat demographic information of authors is encoded in -- and can be recovered\\nfrom -- the intermediate representations learned by text-based neural\\nclassifiers. The implication is that decisions of classifiers trained on\\ntextual data are not agnostic to -- and likely condition on -- demographic\\nattributes. When attempting to remove such demographic information using\\nadversarial training, we find that while the adversarial component achieves\\nchance-level development-set accuracy during training, a post-hoc classifier,\\ntrained on the encoded sentences from the first part, still manages to reach\\nsubstantially higher classification accuracies on the same data. This behavior\\nis consistent across several tasks, demographic properties and datasets. We\\nexplore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial\\ncomponent. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the\\nadversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features.\\n', '  Learning network representations has a variety of applications, such as\\nnetwork classification. Most existing work in this area focuses on static\\nundirected networks and do not account for presence of directed edges or\\ntemporarily changes. Furthermore, most work focuses on node representations\\nthat do poorly on tasks like network classification. In this paper, we propose\\na novel, flexible and scalable network embedding methodology, \\\\emph{gl2vec},\\nfor network classification in both static and temporal directed networks.\\n\\\\emph{gl2vec} constructs vectors for feature representation using static or\\ntemporal network graphlet distributions and a null model for comparing them\\nagainst random graphs. We argue that \\\\emph{gl2vec} can be used to classify and\\ncompare networks of varying sizes and time period with high accuracy. We\\ndemonstrate the efficacy and usability of \\\\emph{gl2vec} over existing\\nstate-of-the-art methods on network classification tasks such as network type\\nclassification and subgraph identification in several real-world static and\\ntemporal directed networks. Experimental results further show that\\n\\\\emph{gl2vec}, concatenated with a wide range of state-of-the-art methods,\\nimproves classification accuracy by up to $10\\\\%$ in real-world applications\\nsuch as detecting departments for subgraphs in an email network or identifying\\nmobile users given their app switching behaviors represented as static or\\ntemporal directed networks.\\n', '  Often, more time is spent on finding a model that works well, rather than\\ntuning the model and working directly with the dataset. Our research began as\\nan attempt to improve upon a simple Recurrent Neural Network for answering\\n\"simple\" first-order questions (QA-RNN), developed by Ferhan Ture and Oliver\\nJojic, from Comcast Labs, using the SimpleQuestions dataset. Their baseline\\nmodel, a bidirectional, 2-layer LSTM RNN and a GRU RNN, have accuracies of 0.94\\nand 0.90, for entity detection and relation prediction, respectively. We fine\\ntuned these models by doing substantial hyper-parameter tuning, getting\\nresulting accuracies of 0.70 and 0.80, for entity detection and relation\\nprediction, respectively. An accuracy of 0.984 was obtained on entity detection\\nusing a 1-layer LSTM, where preprocessing was done by removing all words not\\npart of a noun chunk from the question. 100% of the dataset was available for\\nrelation prediction, but only 20% of the dataset, was available for entity\\ndetection, which we believe to be much of the reason for our initial\\ndifficulties in replicating their
